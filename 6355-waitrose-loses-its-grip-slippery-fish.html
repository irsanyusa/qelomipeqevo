Probably not, but according to YouGov’s social media analysis tool, SoMA, these were the three most popular words mentioned alongside Waitrose on Twitter on 7 June.</p><p>These three words were also primarily responsible for a significant increase in Waitrose’s Twitter activity on that day. On 6 June just 1.9% of the Twitter population were exposed to a mention of Waitrose, compared to 9.9% the following day.</p><img _ngcontent-yg-app-c2171288495 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ygo-assets-websites-editorial-emea.yougov.net/images/Waitrose20SoMA.format-webp.webp alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p>By looking at the verbatim comments on 7 June, we can see that an article appearing in the Independent reporting that Waitrose staff refused to fillet a fish because it was “too slippery” was at the root of the spike in social media activity.</p><p>While a number of the tweets (examples below) mocked Waitrose staff, it nevertheless demonstrates the need for brands to act quickly and decisively before negative PR stories such as this go viral.</p><p>‘Trout of order: Waitrose staff refuse to fillet fish for customer... because it was too slippery’</p><p>‘Waitrose staff not able to fillet trout 'cause they're too slippery!! (fish not staff)’</p><p>Waitrose has since apologised for the incident, but this shows how seemingly minor incidents – particularly those picked up by the media on a slow news day – can spread much further on social media than they likely would if they were confined to the pages of a single broadsheet.</p><p>Learn more about SoMA</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmixn6q0sMKNnKZnrZtkvbC4yK2gnKtflr%2B1tcKlnKxnZmiCdnnWmqCtqp%2Bosm64zqycrGWZqcBus9Gip2arnJ69sbHRsmSfoaOd</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JazzVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
