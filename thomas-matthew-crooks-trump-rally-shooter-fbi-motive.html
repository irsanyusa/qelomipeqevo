Trump’s <a href=#>right ear was wounded, while a</a> bystander died and two others were injured.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">After weeks of investigation, Crooks’ motives remain unclear. Here’s what we know about his background.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline"><strong>‘No indication of any mental health issues’</strong></h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The <a href=#>FBI</a> says that Crooks was not known to the agency prior to the incident.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">In a call with reporters on July 14, the FBI special agent in charge, Kevin Rojek, <a href=#>said</a> there was “no indication of any mental health issues” regarding the shooter.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">During a private congressional briefing on July 17, the <a href=#>New York Times</a> reported, the FBI revealed that the gunman’s online search history included a query on “major depressive disorder.”</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline"><strong>Limited social media presence</strong></h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">President Joe Biden on July 14 <a href=#>urged</a> people to refrain from making assumptions about Crooks’ ideology. “Let the FBI do their job, and their partner agencies do their job,” he said.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The FBI has <a href=#>interviewed more than 100 people</a>, including Crooks’ family and friends, and <a href=#>cracked into his two phones</a> using the <a href=#>Israeli technology</a> Cellebrite, according to the Washington Post, but has yet to find evidence of his motivations.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>Read More:</strong> <a href=#>What to Know About Women in Secret Service as Critics Blame ‘DEI’ for Trump’s Shooting</a></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Crooks reportedly had a limited social media presence, though a spokesperson for the platform Discord said in a statement shared with TIME that the company “identified” a “rarely utilized” account that appears to be linked to Crooks. The spokesperson said that the company is cooperating with law enforcement but that it “found no evidence” the account was used “to plan this incident, promote violence, or discuss his political views.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><a href=#>Fox News</a> reported that the FBI told Senators on July 17 that Crooks had written on gaming platform Steam: “July 13 will be my premiere, watch as it unfolds.” But during congressional testimony on July 24, FBI director Christopher Wray said this statement was not from Crooks but from another individual who was “part of some sick joke.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">In a <a href=#>Senate committee hearing on July 30</a>, FBI Deputy Director Paul Abbate said the agency discovered a social media account believed to be linked to the shooter from 2019 to 2020. Some of the over 700 comments in that account “appear to reflect antisemitic and anti-immigration themes to espouse political violence and are described as extreme in nature,” according to Abbate.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Abbate also said the FBI is verifying a Gab account supposedly linked to Crooks but with “differing points of view” from the other account. Andrew Torba, CEO of Gab, a platform popular among the far-right, <a href=#>said on X</a> that the account associated with Crooks was “unequivocally” in favor of President Biden.&nbsp;</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline"><strong>Registered Republican, donor to progressives</strong></h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">State public voting records show that Crooks was a registered Republican, while Federal Election Commision <a href=#>documents</a> show that a donor with the same name and address gave $15 to ActBlue, the Democratic fundraising apparatus, on Jan. 20, 2021—the date of President Joe Biden’s inauguration. The donation was earmarked for the Progressive Turnout Project.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">A spokesperson for the Progressive Turnout Project told <a href=#>CNN</a> that “the email address associated with the contribution only made the one contribution and was unsubscribed from our lists 2 years ago.” They added: “We unequivocally condemn political violence in all of its forms, and we denounce anyone who chooses violence over peaceful political action.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">During the July 17 congressional briefing, the FBI said it found no indication Crooks had any strong partisan political views and that he had searched images of public figures including Trump and Biden as well as FBI director Wray and Attorney General Merrick Garland, according to the New York Times. Crooks reportedly also looked up dates of Trump’s public appearances and the upcoming <a href=#>Democratic National Convention</a>.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline"><strong>From an affluent Pittsburgh suburb</strong></h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The FBI identified Crooks’ hometown as Bethel Park, a suburb of Pittsburgh about an hour south of where the Trump rally was held. Dan Gryzbek, a county council member representing the area, described the neighborhood where Crooks’ family lived as “pretty firmly middle class, maybe upper-middle class” to the <a href=#>New York Times</a>. According to the <a href=#>Census Bureau</a>, Bethel Park’s population is 93% white with a 1.3 times higher per capita income than the rest of Pennsylvania.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The address of Crooks’ family home was in a district that Biden won in 2020 with 52% of the vote to Trump’s 46%. Crooks’ father is a registered Libertarian and his mother is a registered Democrat, according to voter records, CNN and the Times reported. Both parents are licensed professional counselors, according to state records.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Sources told the <a href=#>Washington Post</a> that both Crooks’ parents have health issues and appeared to investigators as loving parents who may not have been closely attuned to their son’s activities.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline"><strong>Seems to have acted alone</strong></h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“While the investigation to date indicates the shooter acted alone,” the FBI said on July 14, “the FBI continues to conduct logical investigative activity to determine if there were any co-conspirators associated with this attack. At this time, there are no current public safety concerns.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The FBI repeated that Crooks appeared to act alone during the agency’s briefing to Congress on July 17. Director Wray also said there’s no known foreign nexus, in response to a question from Sen. Dan Sullivan (R-Alaska) in reference to recent reporting about an unrelated Iranian assassination plot targeting Trump, <a href=#>PunchBowl News</a> reported.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Wray also told the House Judiciary Committee on July 24 that on July 6, Crooks searched on Google “how far away was Oswald from Kennedy”—referring to the <a href=#>assassination</a> of former President John F. Kennedy by Lee Harvey Oswald<a href=#>—and on the </a>same day, he registered to attend Trump’s Butler rally.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The next day, Abbate said in the July 30 hearing, Crooks was at the Butler rally site for about 20 minutes, which showed his “advanced planning and reconnaissance.”</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline"><strong>Used an AR-15-style rifle purchased legally by his father</strong></h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Multiple law enforcement officials have said that the firearm used by Crooks in the shooting was an AR-style rifle that was legally purchased by Crooks’ father in 2013. Crooks’ family is cooperating with investigators, Rojek has said.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Read More: <a href=#>How the AR-15 Rifle Became America’s Most Dangerous Weapon</a></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><a href=#>NBC News</a> reported July 15 that more than a dozen other guns were found in a search of the Crooks’ family home.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">A law enforcement official told <a href=#>CNN</a> Monday that on the morning of the Trump campaign rally, Crooks purchased a five-foot ladder and 50 rounds of ammunition before driving to Butler. It’s unclear if Crooks used these in the assassination attempt.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline"><strong>A rifle enthusiast since he was a teen</strong></h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">According to photos and videos of the scene of the shooting, Crooks was wearing a shirt associated with Demolition Ranch, a popular gun channel on YouTube. (Matt Carriker, the host of the channel, said in a <a href=#>video statement</a> on July 15 that he was “shocked and confused” and offered condolences to the <a href=#>victims of the shooting</a>. “This channel was never meant to incite violence or hate—it never has, it isn’t, and it never will be a channel that does that,” he said.)</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Crooks had tried out for his high school’s junior varsity rifle team when he was a freshman, <a href=#>CBS</a> reported, but classmate Jameson Myers said Crooks didn’t make the team and never tried out again.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Jameson Murphy, another former classmate, told the <a href=#>New York Post</a> that Crooks “was such a comically bad shot he was unable to make the team and left after the first day.” Another classmate also told the Post that the rifle team coach had concerns about Crooks based on “some crass jokes” Crooks made and how he interacted with others. “Our old coach was a stickler, he trained Navy marksmen, so he knew people. He knew when someone’s not the greatest person,” the classmate said.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Crooks did, however, belong to a local gun club, the <a href=#>Clairton Sportsmen’s Club</a>, which has a 200-yard rifle range among its facilities. The club confirmed Crooks’ membership in a statement provided to multiple media outlets that admonished the violence and offered condolences to the victims but said it couldn’t offer any more details as investigations remain ongoing.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The day before the shooting, Crooks visited a shooting range to practice firing, according to a law enforcement official speaking to CNN.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Amid speculation that Crooks may have had a military background, the Pentagon told the <a href=#>Associated Press</a> that “there is no military service affiliation for the suspect with that name or date of birth” in their databases across military branches.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline"><strong>Left behind explosive materials</strong></h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The FBI said that, when it searched Crooks’ home and vehicle to collect additional evidence, suspicious devices were found and have since been “rendered safe” by bomb technicians.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">According to CNN, investigators found a bulletproof vest, three fully loaded magazines, and two remote-controlled explosives in his car, which was parked near the rally. An unnamed law enforcement official told CNN Crooks was found with a detonator on his body, and his car’s trunk contained a metal box of explosives connected with wires to a receiver. He also had a drone, which, the <a href=#>Wall Street Journal</a> reported, he used to aerially scout the site of the rally just hours before the shooting.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Sources told <a href=#>Fox News</a> that law enforcement also found bomb-making materials in Crooks’ home, while CNN reported that investigators found an additional remote-controlled explosive device, another bulletproof vest, and a 3D printer in his home—and that Crooks had received deliveries of multiple packages, including some marked as potentially hazardous, in recent months.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline"><strong>A nursing home aid with an engineering science degree</strong></h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Crooks graduated from the Community College of Allegheny County with an associate degree in engineering science just over two months ago, a school official confirmed to the New York Times.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Crooks worked as a dietary aid at the Bethel Park Skilled Nursing and Rehabilitation Center. “We are shocked and saddened to learn of his involvement,” Marcie Grimm, the facility administrator, said in a statement to multiple media outlets, adding that Crooks “performed his job without concern and his background check was clean.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">A colleague at the nursing home described Crooks as caring and apolitical at work to <a href=#>CNN</a>. “It’s hard seeing everything that’s going on online,” the colleague said, “because he was a really, really good person that did a really bad thing, and I just wish I knew why.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Officials told <a href=#>CNN</a> that Crooks normally worked on Saturdays but had requested time off on the day of Trump’s rally, telling his boss that he had “something to do.”</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline"><strong>A quiet, lonely nerd in high school</strong></h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Bethel Park School District confirmed in a <a href=#>statement</a> that Crooks graduated from Bethel Park High in 2022. It offered its condolences to victims of the shooting and said it is cooperating with law enforcement investigations.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">According to the <a href=#>New York Times</a>, Crooks’ only record of disciplinary problems was being sent to detention once in the eighth grade for chewing gum.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Former peers, speaking to media outlets, painted a portrait of a social outcast who kept a low profile.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“He didn’t really fit in with everybody else,” classmate Sarah D’Angelo told the <a href=#>Wall Street Journal</a>. “He was there but I can’t think of anyone who knew him well,” another classmate told <a href=#>BBC</a>.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Crooks was “a loner” who “would sit alone at lunch,” classmate Jason Kohler told <a href=#>ABC News</a>. He would regularly wear camouflage outfits and was “bullied” for the way he dressed, Kohler told <a href=#>NBC News</a>.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“There was definitely chatter about him just looking a little different,” another classmate, who asked not to be named, told <a href=#>CNN</a>. “Almost a retro nerd vibe.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Summer Barkley, another classmate, told BBC that Crooks was “always getting good grades on tests” and was “very passionate about history.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Zach Bradford, another classmate, described Crooks to the <a href=#>New York Times</a> as “incredibly intelligent” and said his views in high school seemed “slightly right leaning.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Most—but not all—who knew Crooks expressed disbelief at his involvement in the shooting at the Trump rally.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Jim Knapp, Crooks’ since-retired guidance counselor at the school, described Crooks to the <a href=#>Times</a> as “a very good student” and said “not once did he ever get in trouble.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“He never outwardly spoke about his political views or how much he hated Trump or anything,” D’Angelo added to the Wall Street Journal.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“I was just, like, shocked—I just couldn’t believe he did something that bold, considering he was such a quiet and kept-to-himself kind of person,” the anonymous classmate told CNN.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“I will say he was definitely nerdy, for sure, but he never gave off that he was creepy,” classmate Mark Sigafoos told CBS. “He seemed like he wouldn’t hurt a fly.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">But Julianna Grooms, who graduated a year after Crooks, told the Wall Street Journal that Crooks stood out for his awkwardness. “If someone would say something to his face, he would just kind of stare at them,” she said. “People would say he was the student who would shoot up high school.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">—Koh Ewe contributed reporting.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmZvcWltgnaDjq2fqKWRqHqurdOtn56vXZi%2FsLvKrGStqqWivW6%2BwKWjsmWjnbywwMSrZJ%2BamWK6sMDIr5xo</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JazzVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
