So the next time someone asks you “Welchen Wochentag haben wir heute?”, you know you’ll give the right answer!</p><p><h2 class=headline>Start your journey to reach fluency</h2></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=German-days-of-the-week>German days of the week</h2><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Montag is “Monday” in German</h3><p>Much like the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">English day of the week</a>, Montag is related to thinking of Monday as the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">moon’s day</a>.</p><p>Mond is the word for the moon in German, so much like the word in English, it got a bit smooshed together over the years.&nbsp;</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Dienstag is “Tuesday” in German</h3><p>Even though it doesn’t look anything like Tuesday in English, it actually is related.</p><p>It was originally named after an old German called Tyr or Tíw, hence Tuesday in English. However, by the time modern German rolled around, it became Dienstag, or the day of service, possibly from the Latin dies Martes.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Mittwoch is “Wednesday” in German</h3><p>This is an easy one. Literally the middle of the week (Mitte is middle or center and Woche is week), it makes much more sense in German.</p><p>Interestingly, the word Wednesday in English comes from the name of the old Germanic god Woden, sometimes called Odin in Scandinavian mythology.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Donnerstag is “Thursday” in German</h3><p>Donner means thunder in German, and we all know which god/superhero controls the thunder, right? It’s Thor with his mighty hammer.</p><p>In German, we have thunder’s day, and in English, we have a version of Thor’s day, so really quite similar!</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Freitag is “Friday” in German</h3><p>Both the <a href=#>English and German words</a> here are related to the Norse goddess of love, Frige. She was Woden’s wife, and managed everything to do with marriage, love, home and children.</p><p>Interestingly, many assumed Friday was named after Freya. However, it is a little unclear as to whether these two goddesses are actually different or not.</p><p>Dive deep into Norse mythology for the answer for that one, but the English and German days have the same root, whichever goddess it is!</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Samstag is “Saturday” in German</h3><p>We return to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"><span>Latin </span></a>for this one, as both English and German draw on dies Saturni (the day of Saturn) for their names.</p><p>Note! In some areas in north and eastern Germany, you might also hear the word Sonnenabend which also refers to Saturday. It makes sense because it translates to the evening before sunday.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Sonntag is “Sunday” in German</h3><p>Just like in English, Sonntag is straightforwardly the sun day.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Remember</strong>: All the days of the week are <strong>masculine</strong>, using der and ein.&nbsp;</p><p><h2 class=headline>Start your journey to reach fluency</h2></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=A-trick-for-Dienstag-and-Donnerstag>A trick for Dienstag and Donnerstag</h2><p>Getting Dienstag and Donnerstag mixed up is a rite of passage for any new German speaker. So, don’t get those two mixed up when you have an appointment, or you might miss it!</p><p>One trick that might help is this: Dienstag is the shorter word, so it comes earlier in the week. And since Donnerstag is longer, it falls later in the week.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=Abbreviations-of-the-days>Abbreviations of the days</h2><p>The <a href=#>abbreviation</a> of the German days of the week is shortened to only two letters, with no full stop to denote the short form. Like this:</p><figure class="wp-block-table is-style-stripes"><table class=has-fixed-layout><tr><th class=has-text-align-center data-align=center>English</th><th class=has-text-align-center data-align=center>German</th><th class=has-text-align-center data-align=center>Abbreviations</th></tr><tbody><tr><td class=has-text-align-center data-align=center>Monday</td><td class=has-text-align-center data-align=center>Montag</td><td class=has-text-align-center data-align=center>Mo</td></tr><tr><td class=has-text-align-center data-align=center>Tuesday</td><td class=has-text-align-center data-align=center>Dienstag</td><td class=has-text-align-center data-align=center>Di</td></tr><tr><td class=has-text-align-center data-align=center>Wednesday</td><td class=has-text-align-center data-align=center>Mittwoch</td><td class=has-text-align-center data-align=center>Mi</td></tr><tr><td class=has-text-align-center data-align=center>Thursday</td><td class=has-text-align-center data-align=center>Donnerstag</td><td class=has-text-align-center data-align=center>Do</td></tr><tr><td class=has-text-align-center data-align=center>Friday</td><td class=has-text-align-center data-align=center>Freitag</td><td class=has-text-align-center data-align=center>Fr</td></tr><tr><td class=has-text-align-center data-align=center>Saturday</td><td class=has-text-align-center data-align=center>Samstag</td><td class=has-text-align-center data-align=center>Sa</td></tr><tr><td class=has-text-align-center data-align=center>Sunday</td><td class=has-text-align-center data-align=center>Sonntag</td><td class=has-text-align-center data-align=center>So</td></tr></tbody></table></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=Reading-signs-with-days-in-German>Reading signs with days in German</h2><p>Quickly reading signs when <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">driving, parking</a>, looking new bus schedules and store opening hours means you’ll be using these skills a lot.</p><p>The phrasing ‘von… bis’ means ‘from… to‘, for example: Von Dienstag bis Donnerstag (from Tuesday to Thursday).</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Ich tanze montags</h2><p>Finally, if you want to talk about something happening every week on a specific day, you <strong>no longer capitalize</strong> the day of the week and add an ‘s’. If I want to say, “I dance on Mondays”, it would be: Ich tanze montags.&nbsp;</p><p>Now that you’ve learned about the German days of the week, dive into our next article to know <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">how to say months and dates in German</a>.</p><p><h2 class=headline>Start your journey to reach fluency</h2></p><p>Erin McGann is a Canadian freelance writer focusing on travel, living abroad, parenting, history, and culture.
