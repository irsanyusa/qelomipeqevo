During their conversation, Guadagnino spoke about his experience with body dysmorphia.</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-dwts-alum-vinny-guadagnino-talks-about-body-dysmorphia>DWTS Alum Vinny Guadagnino Talks About Body Dysmorphia</h2><p>Guadagnino told Burke that his passion for a ketogenic diet started when Jersey Shore first went off the air, as he wasn’t losing weight as easily as he used to. When he started the diet, Guadagnino shared that he lost 50 pounds. He later started dancing for Chippendales.</p><p>Burke asked if he’s ever experienced body dysmorphia. Guadagnino shared that he started developing abs after getting on a keto diet, and he became “a little bit obsessive” about his body. He explained that he really has to work to stay in shape.</p><p>“I definitely have body dysmorphia. I look at myself sometimes, and I’m like, ‘Oh my God, I’m so fat,'” Guadagnino shared. “Right now I’m dealing with a back injury, so I haven’t been able to work out for real in like two months. And I can literally see my waistline growing in front of me.”</p><p>The star added that he’s “gotten better at forgiving myself, loving myself.” Right now, he shared his determination to “work with what I got” and “keep moving forward” until he can get back into the gym.</p><p class=has-text-align-left><strong>SEE ALSO:</strong> <strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">VINNY GUADAGNINO RETURNS FOR ‘ALL STAR SHORE’ SEASON 2 WITH EXPLOSIVE DRAMA</a></strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-guadagnino-shares-biggest-lesson-he-learned-on-the-show>Guadagnino Shares Biggest Lesson He Learned on the Show</h2><p>Burke asked Guadagnino to share the biggest lesson he learned during his time on DWTS. He said the show taught him “not to be so hard on myself” and to “leave room for variability” while realizing that “you don’t have to be perfect.”</p><p>“A lesson that you taught me… this is just a silly show. You’re not curing cancer,” Guadagnino recalled. “Just take a deep breath. While the rest of the world are putting so much importance on things, just be more of an ‘I don’t give a sh*t’ type of person.”</p><p>Guadagnino said competing on DWTS was something he “always wanted to do” after being a fan of the show for years. He and his dance partner Koko Iwasaki finished Season 31 in seventh place.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Original_KellyClarkson_GwenStefani_Trae-Patton_NBC-220x147.jpg alt="Gwen Stefani Says Kelly Clarkson Inspired Her to Make New Music" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57w7CrrGWRocKuedWipaexXZzCorDAoKWipp9itKbA0mafqKaVqMFurcGorK1lkqSxunnDsqqmp6Kltaqtjg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JazzVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
