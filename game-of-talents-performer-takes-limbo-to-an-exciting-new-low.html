The show, hosted by Wayne Brady, features several performers whose talents are a mystery to the contestants.</strong></p><p>Tonight’s teams were best friends Danny and Kya, as well as roommates Diego and Dalia. They were tasked with guessing the talents of various guests. The teams were given several talents to choose from, but only six out of seven were actual talents featured during the show.</p><p>Wednesday’s episode featured a contemporary dancer, a martial artist, and a yodeler. But the most memorable performances of the night came from a limbo skater and a chainsaw juggler.</p><p class=has-text-align-center><strong>SEE ALSO: <a href=#>NEW SINGING COMPETITION ‘ALTER EGO’ TAKES ‘GAME OF TALENTS’ TIME SLOT</a></strong></p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-game-of-talents-performer-limbos-on-roller-skates>‘Game of Talents’ Performer Limbos on Roller Skates</h2><p>Kaitlyn Conner introduced herself to the teams as a “cat lady.” A clue package featured an apartment complex notice board. Danny and Kya guessed that Kaitlyn was a yodeler. Diego and Dalia disagreed, believing she was a chainsaw juggler.</p><p>It turns out, they were both wrong. Kaitlyn is actually a limbo skater. And that’s exactly what you think it is. She donned a pair of roller skates and slid under a limbo stick. At one point, she did a split and glided so low it didn’t even look physically possible.</p><p>Kaitlyn shared that she’s known as a “limbo queen.” Brady explained that one of the biggest clues in the package was an advertisement for “Slim boB’s,” which spelled out “limbo” in the middle. Kaitlyn’s talent was something a lot of people probably don’t know about, and it was so much fun to watch.</p><p class=has-text-align-center><strong>SEE ALSO: <a href=#>WILL ‘GAME OF TALENTS’ BE RENEWED FOR A SECOND SEASON?</a></strong></p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-performer-juggles-chainsaws-and-flaming-axes>Performer Juggles Chainsaws and Flaming Axes</h3><p>Wednesday’s episode also featured one of the most dangerous acts shown this season. Performer Aaron Bonk told the teams that he enjoys kayaking. His clue package featured good luck cards that included phrases like “sharp cookie” and “I hope you’re not rusty.”</p><p>Diego and Dalia locked in chainsaw juggler as their answer, and they were correct — sending them to the final round. Aaron used a chainsaw to cut a cucumber in his mouth. He then lit two axes on fire and juggled them with the chainsaw. He shared that he’s also a whip artist.</p><p>In the final round, Diego and Dalia chose to walk away with $80,000, rather than risk losing it all with a guess. Unlike last week, tonight’s game featured <a href=#>more than one correct guess</a>. However, if the show is renewed for another season, they might want to consider adjusting the format so it’s not so easy to walk away with thousands without getting anything right.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/BGT-News-Connie-Talbot-before-and-after-scaled-1.jpeg alt="Adorable Singer Connie Talbot Impresses Simon Cowell…Twice!" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <span class=title-post-tagcloud>Tags</span> <a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>Game of Talents</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57xpqknmWfm3q1rcuepa2rXaWys7LOq6Seql2prqyx0majoqWSpHq1u4yapWadqJi2tbXNoGSnnadiubDDjg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JazzVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
