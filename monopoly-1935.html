The game seemed too long, too complicated, and too niche: who, after all, would get excited about buying imaginary realty in Atlantic City?</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The brainchild of an out-of-work heating contractor named Charles Darrow, <a href=# rel=noopener>according to </a>the New York Times, the game that became Monopoly wildly outperformed Parker Brothers’ modest expectations, becoming <a href=#>the most popular game in history</a>. Although they initially rejected Darrow’s offer to sell it to them, the powers that be at Parker Brothers changed their minds after the independently manufactured game began flying off the shelves of a Philadelphia department store, though the company still believed the game was a fad that would soon fade. They began marketing it as Monopoly on this day, Nov. 5, in 1935.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Monopoly sales soon made Darrow so rich that he abandoned the heating trade for a hothouse hobby: growing orchids. According to<a href=# rel=noopener> Hasbro</a>, which acquired Parker Brothers in 1991, more than 275 million Monopoly games — including more than 6 billion green houses and 2.25 billion red hotels — have been sold since 1935.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">And while Monopoly remains a fixture in American homes, it has undergone periodic changes in an effort to stay relevant. Last year, following a vote on the<a href=# rel=noopener> Monopoly Facebook page</a>, game lovers chose a new token — a cat, which triumphed over proposed tokens including a toy robot, a guitar, a helicopter, and a diamond ring — to replace the least popular of the existing tokens: the iron. It wasn’t the first <a href=# rel=noopener>upheaval</a> among the tokens, which have at times included a purse, a lantern, an elephant, a horse and rider, and a rocking horse. The game board has gone through a number of updates, too, and met with mixed reviews.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">In 1978, to celebrate the legalization of gambling in Atlantic City, Parker Brothers released a new version called “Advance to Boardwalk,” which allowed players to build casinos, <a href=# rel=noopener>according</a> to the Times. It never became popular.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">In 2006, Hasbro released the “Here and Now” edition, meant to bring the game into the 21st century — in all its branded glory — with corporatized tokens including McDonald’s fries, a Starbucks coffee cup, a New Balance sneaker and a Toyota Prius. According to TIME’s<a href=#> coverage of the new edition</a>, the properties in that version:</p><figure class=text-left readability=30.5><p>… include real estate from around the country, selected by online vote. The railroads have become airports. Weimar-style hyperinflation has set in–for passing Go, you collect $2 million–but Times Square is a bargain at $4 mil, and while it’s a refreshing admission that, yes, you can buy the White House, it cost the present occupant far more than $3.2 million.</p></figure><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">This spring, Hasbro adopted a grassroots approach to improving the game by polling players on their “house rules,” acknowledging <a href=# rel=noopener>their findings </a>that half of all Monopoly players have made up their own rules and 68% have never read the official rules all the way through. The House Rules Edition includes the <a href=# rel=noopener>five most popular</a> of those made-up rules, which include doubling the amount collected for passing “Go,” collecting an additional $500 for rolling “snake eyes,” and not collecting rent while in jail.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">To appease purists, Hasbro<a href=# rel=noopener> points out</a> that these rules are, of course, entirely optional.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>Read more about the 2006 edition of Monopoly, here in TIME’s archives</strong>: <a href=# rel=noopener>Monopoly in Elysium</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmZsbWRrgHF%2Fjqamp6egpLm6eZByam5n</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JazzVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
