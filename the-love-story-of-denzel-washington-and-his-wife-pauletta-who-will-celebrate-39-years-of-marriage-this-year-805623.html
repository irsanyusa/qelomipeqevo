The couple will be&nbsp;celebrating their thirty-ninth wedding anniversary this year, and they’ve been in&nbsp;a&nbsp;relationship for 45&nbsp;years. Although Denzel had a&nbsp;rough childhood, this also prompted him to&nbsp;become a&nbsp;better father and husband.</p><p>We&nbsp;at&nbsp;<strong>Bright Side</strong> truly appreciate when 2&nbsp;people commit to&nbsp;each other, and that’s why we’d like to&nbsp;share the love story of&nbsp;Pauletta and Denzel Washington with you.</p><p><h2>1. They often tease each other about their first date.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/d55/db6/6ed90a5d339399cab7d82d52f2.jpg><p>Like many other actors who started dating, <strong>Pauletta and Denzel met on&nbsp;</strong><a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><strong>set</strong></a><strong>.</strong> They both had roles in&nbsp;the&nbsp;TV movie, <i>Wilma</i>, in&nbsp;1977, when they were at&nbsp;the start of&nbsp;their careers. Later, they were introduced to&nbsp;each other at&nbsp;a&nbsp;party. Denzel jokingly revealed that at&nbsp;that party, he&nbsp;talked about seeing a&nbsp;play, and when he&nbsp;went to&nbsp;see the play, he&nbsp;ran into Pauletta again. They went on&nbsp;their <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>first date</a> where Pauletta had to&nbsp;pay for the cab because Denzel had run out of&nbsp;money. And their relationship has lasted ever since.</p><p><h2>2. Pauletta turned down Denzel’s proposal...twice.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/66b/548/9ded255ef988a3d1857ff7d8f0.jpg><p>Although the couple has been happily married for almost 4&nbsp;decades, <strong>Denzel had to&nbsp;</strong><a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><strong>propose</strong></a><strong> 3&nbsp;times for Pauletta to&nbsp;finally say, “Yes!”</strong> Years later, in&nbsp;an&nbsp;interview with <i>Access Hollywood</i>, even Denzel Washington was confused as&nbsp;to&nbsp;why the first 2&nbsp;attempts had failed. <strong>“Because I&nbsp;said&nbsp;no,”</strong> was his now wife’s straightforward answer.</p><p>When Pauletta was eventually ready to&nbsp;tie the knot, <strong>the 2&nbsp;Hollywood stars got married in&nbsp;1983</strong>. Their <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>wedding</a> reception held a&nbsp;few surprises as&nbsp;well, as&nbsp;the newlyweds were so&nbsp;busy entertaining their guests that they ran out of&nbsp;food by&nbsp;the time they sat down to&nbsp;eat. To&nbsp;appease their hunger, they went to&nbsp;get an&nbsp;early breakfast at&nbsp;a&nbsp;local diner.</p><p><h2>3. They made sure to&nbsp;still appreciate each other’s company while building a&nbsp;family.</h2></p><p>Throughout the years, both Pauletta and Denzel stressed that <strong>there is&nbsp;no&nbsp;one secret to&nbsp;a&nbsp;successful marriage</strong>, but being committed to&nbsp;each other and working on&nbsp;issues that might arise is&nbsp;key. “It’s not all the honeymoon, it&nbsp;doesn’t last forever, so&nbsp;you work at&nbsp;it. And <strong>hopefully, you’re good friends first</strong>, that might help!” said Denzel Washington in&nbsp;a&nbsp;2013&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>interview</a>.</p><p>After being married for 12&nbsp;years and building a&nbsp;family together, the pair renewed their <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>vows</a> in&nbsp;1995 during a&nbsp;romantic ceremony in&nbsp;South Africa.</p><p><h2>4. Denzel became the father he&nbsp;never had.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/6de/b54/c54912582384c165713c9a5354.jpg><p>Denzel revealed that <strong>his </strong><a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><strong>parents</strong></a><strong> got divorced when he&nbsp;was 14&nbsp;years old</strong>. He&nbsp;was left with his single mother and was a&nbsp;rebellious teenager. Although they weren’t well off, Denzel’s mother decided to&nbsp;send him to&nbsp;a&nbsp;private school around this time, as&nbsp;she didn’t like the people her son was hanging out with. Despite this strict upbringing, the actor later came <strong>to&nbsp;appreciate the sacrifices his mom made for him</strong> while his father was absent after the divorce.</p><p>Despite his own difficult childhood, Denzel and his wife, Pauletta, made sure to&nbsp;raise their children in&nbsp;a&nbsp;happy, stable <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>home</a>. “<strong>My&nbsp;children are good people.</strong> They are not perfect but they are <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>generous </a>and humble and kind. My&nbsp;wife did that.”</p><p><h2>5. Their children are following in&nbsp;their footsteps.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/311/182/4acf97592cb416913b9883ee34.jpg><p>Pauletta and Denzel Washington welcomed their first child a&nbsp;year after getting married. John David Washington, who has since become a&nbsp;Hollywood A-lister, was followed by&nbsp;Katia, and in&nbsp;1991, by&nbsp;twins, Olivia and Malcolm. All of&nbsp;<strong>the Washington </strong><a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><strong>children</strong></a><strong> have budding careers in&nbsp;the movie industry</strong> just like their parents.</p><p><h2>6. “My&nbsp;wife has made our house a&nbsp;home...she did the heavy lifting.”</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/bcd/91d/546177524bbccec0dc457a008e.jpg><p>While Denzel’s acting career took off and put him more in&nbsp;the public eye than Pauletta, she says this didn’t negatively affect their connection, as&nbsp;they only grew closer. “As&nbsp;you climb, you grow deeper in&nbsp;the foundation, so&nbsp;<strong>it&nbsp;makes our </strong><a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><strong>foundation</strong></a><strong> deeper</strong>.”</p><p>And Denzel has always made sure throughout the years to&nbsp;give Pauletta credit where it&nbsp;was due. “<strong>My&nbsp;wife has made our house a&nbsp;home</strong>, and raised these beautiful kids, and protected them and sacrificed for them. <strong>She did the heavy lifting</strong>.”</p><p>How long have you been together with your partner? Do&nbsp;you have any other tips for how to&nbsp;make a&nbsp;relationship last?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZMGpsYylpq%2BdXajBsL7YZqafZZSau7uxy2aumquYnruowM6nZJqmlGK1qr%2BMsKCfnV2lrra4xK2rmmWnnbxuw8ilo2ablaGyo77ArZxma2lixqat0axkqJ5doq6zvsianp5lpJ22tHnYnpirZWhlgnd%2Bkmg%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JazzVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
