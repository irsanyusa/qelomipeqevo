We take a deep dive into who the relatively mysterious new lover of the former One Direction member.</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-who-is-kate-cassidy>Who is Kate Cassidy?</h2><p>The former One Direction member made headlines after going trick-or-treating with his new love interest back in October. They were then spotted smitten with one another as they made their red carpet entrance walking hand in hand.</p><p>Cassidy is a 23-year-old New Jersey native, she is half-British through her father and has spent the last couple of months living in London. She received her schooling at the College of Charleston in South Carolina, the nation’s thirteenth-oldest institution of higher education.</p><p>Cassidy is said to be a well-known party girl in the London nightlife scene. It’s likely that they first met while the two attended the same party, and got to know each other there. Cassidy hinted at the time, about the budding romance with Payne after uploading a selfie of herself with the singer on her <a href=# class=broken_link>Instagram account</a>.</p><p>It seems like Cassidy likes traveling to new places. She documents several places she’s been both in the United States and in Europe, in her Instagram posts. She is a well-known social media influencer, having more than 17 thousand Instagram followers.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>A Brief History of Liam Payne’s Past Relationships</h2><p>Texan model Maya Henry and Payne have been dating for two years leading to an engagement that almost went through. The former couple announced their engagement in 2020, but in June 2021, they had a temporary separation before picking up again two months later.</p><p>They remained as fiancees since then but broke off their relationship after a tumultuous engagement. Following his breakup with his fiancée, Payne was linked to model Aliana Mawla. In May 2022, photos emerged of <a href=#>the singer </a>with Mawla, leading many fans to speculate that Payne had cheated on his previous relationship.</p><p>Payne and Mawla broke up in June 2022, and he subsequently moved on with his ex-girlfriend Danielle Peazer. Payne has also dated The X-Factor host Cheryl Cole, with whom he shares his son Bear, 5. He claimed during his May 2022 interview that his relationship with Cole was “ruined” following the birth of their son.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Original_SofieDossi_Leon-BennettGetty-Images-220x201.jpg alt="Sofie Dossi Talks About The Creation of ‘Fire Alarm’, “I Did Not Expect to Release This”" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57xK%2Bcq7Gknbavs4yypq5lnpqypXnTqGSkpp%2BseqKuzq6rZqSZlrpuvMCypZ6rXZy2s7jFq6CeppRiuKLAxGaamqujnrG6ew%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JazzVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
