Since the show was pre-recorded, the final result was decided by <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">a group of Superfans</a>.

A lot of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener" class=broken_link>Reddit users</a> were happy to see Bryant take home the win after coming in second place in Season 16. However, there were also plenty of comments about how the rest of the Top 5 turned out.</p><p>The All-Stars runner-up was saxophonist Avery Dixon, and the rest of the Top 5 consisted of magician Aidan McCann, ventriloquist Ana-Maria Mărgean, and dance group Light Balance Kids. That means impressive acts such as Kodi Lee and Tom Ball were left out of the Top 5.</p><p>As one <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener" class=broken_link>Reddit user</a> put it, “How the HELL did the kid magician make it over Tom and Kodi?” Another <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener" class=broken_link>wrote</a>, “Kodi out of the top 5, Light Balance only ending in three, and Avery in the top two??? WHO voted on this? How?”</p><p>Another fan <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener" class=broken_link>wrote</a>, “Only things the ‘superfans’ (I don’t even think they are real at this point) got right is picked deserved winner.” Someone else <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener" class=broken_link>wondered</a> simply, “Were the super fans watching the same acts we did?”</p><p class=has-text-align-center><strong>SEE ALSO: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">‘AGT ALL-STARS’ STANDOUT AVERY DIXON TO EMBARK ON HIS FIRST OUT OF COUNTRY TOUR</a></strong></p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-not-everyone-was-happy-with-the-winner>Not Everyone Was Happy with the Winner</h2><p>Although fans on Reddit seemed to mostly be disappointed by the Top 5 in general, plenty of fans on Twitter were upset that Aidan Bryant was named the winner. Responses to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">AGT‘s tweet</a> announcing the result include quite a few complaints.</p><p>“Definitely wasn’t the best act. Maybe 4th or 5th place. Terrible season ending,” wrote <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">one fan</a>. As usual, there were also plenty of accusations that the show is “rigged,” and complaints about the Superfans.</p><p>Other users shared which act they thought was more deserving of the win. Kodi Lee, Light Balance Kids, and Tom Ball seemed to be popular choices.</p><p>What did you think of Monday night’s finale? Do you think Aidan Bryant deserved to win?
