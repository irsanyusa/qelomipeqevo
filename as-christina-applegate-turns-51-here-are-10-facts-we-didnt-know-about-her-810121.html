Thankfully, doctors discovered it&nbsp;in&nbsp;the early stage because, as&nbsp;a&nbsp;daughter of&nbsp;a&nbsp;breast cancer survivor, she was getting regular mammograms. When she found out about her diagnosis, she reached out to&nbsp;friends and family, including Melissa Etheridge, who is&nbsp;also a&nbsp;breast cancer <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>survivor</a>.</p><p>Etheridge shared a&nbsp;pearl of&nbsp;wisdom with Christina that she learned while fighting for her own life. “This is&nbsp;a&nbsp;blessing that’s happened to&nbsp;you in&nbsp;your life. Right now, you get to&nbsp;start over, and right now you get to&nbsp;change everything&nbsp;— the way that you deal with things in&nbsp;life, the way that you react to&nbsp;things. Fear can hurt you. Stress can hurt you. This is&nbsp;the time that you have this opportunity to&nbsp;change the way you eat...everything you&nbsp;do.”</p><p>Now, thanks to&nbsp;her friend, Applegate looks at&nbsp;the diagnosis as&nbsp;a&nbsp;blessing. After her lumpectomy, 6&nbsp;weeks of&nbsp;radiation, and a&nbsp;positive BRCA gene test, Applegate decided to&nbsp;undergo a&nbsp;double mastectomy, so&nbsp;she wouldn’t have to&nbsp;go&nbsp;through surgeries again and do&nbsp;checkups for the rest of&nbsp;her life.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/4dd/9a5/04d096597991536c4ea07900c6.jpg><p>KENNELL KRISTA/SIPA/EAST NEWS</p><p><h2>She became a&nbsp;first-time mom after her double mastectomy.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/7f5/8c1/5328c6532381fab4329a5cd67f.jpg><p>Broadimage/EAST NEWS</p><p>Becoming a&nbsp;mom helped Applegate heal in&nbsp;so&nbsp;many <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>ways</a>.
