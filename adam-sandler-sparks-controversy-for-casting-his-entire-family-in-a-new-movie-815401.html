His production company, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Happy Madison</a>, has made more than 50&nbsp;films, and often, Sandler or&nbsp;his close buddies take the lead roles in&nbsp;these movies. While his daughters have had small parts in&nbsp;some of&nbsp;his films, they haven’t had big starring roles, until now.</p><p>In&nbsp;an&nbsp;interview, Sandler once <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>talked</a> about how he&nbsp;ends up&nbsp;working with his comedian friends. “I&nbsp;know how great they are and how funny they are, so&nbsp;I try to&nbsp;include them in&nbsp;my&nbsp;movies as&nbsp;much as&nbsp;I&nbsp;can, and they do&nbsp;the same for&nbsp;me.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/e81/785/202b2155b287e27fc4db1c2c2f.png><p><h2>The casting decision sparked some debate over nepotism.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/ae5/04a/589e855b8ca58cac9be8ecb133.jpg><p>Lewis Joly / Associated Press / East News</p><p>The decision to&nbsp;cast his own family members has caused a&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>debate</a> online due to&nbsp;“nepotism” accusations. Some people started questioning if&nbsp;it&nbsp;was a&nbsp;good thing that he&nbsp;cast his daughters. One comment even <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>pointed</a> out, “I&nbsp;mean nepo babies get talented because they’re nepo babies, I&nbsp;would probably be&nbsp;a&nbsp;better, more famous actor if&nbsp;my&nbsp;dad was Adam Sandler and had all the acting connections he&nbsp;does.”</p><p>But not all comments were negative, there were some <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>people</a> who even called Sandler’s daughters their “favorite nepo babies.”</p><p><h2>The director of&nbsp;the movie defended him.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/c44/142/5057b75505ac2a1f09c1a0154b.jpg><p>The director of&nbsp;the movie, Sammi Cohen, came <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>forward</a> to&nbsp;support Adam Sandler’s decision to&nbsp;cast his daughters. She mentioned, “They’ve had roles in&nbsp;other movies, and they’re familiar with being on&nbsp;set, but one thing that just sticks out&nbsp;— they work harder than most adults I&nbsp;know.” Cohen highlighted the dedication and passion Sandler’s daughters had for acting and filmmaking.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/923/c07/d6a651544d9ecc90eb64ef0fb1.jpg><p>KENNELL KRISTA / SIPA / East News</p><p>She also <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>pointed</a> out that Sandler is&nbsp;known for making movies with his friends, and now, he’s simply extending that <a href=# title=tradition data-link=tag>tradition</a> to&nbsp;include his kids. Cohen said, “He&nbsp;is&nbsp;the kind of&nbsp;dad who’s also your best friend. When it&nbsp;comes to&nbsp;the sort of&nbsp;chatter we’re hearing online, I&nbsp;don’t really think twice about it&nbsp;because I’m going like, ’Yeah, he’s doing the same thing he’s always done.’”</p><p>While casting family members and close friends in&nbsp;films has been a&nbsp;long-standing tradition among celebrities, the topic has gained fresh momentum in&nbsp;recent times.
