During the past week, the Dancing With The Stars pro lost 10 pounds after suffering from cruel sickness.</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Val Chmerkovskiy Involuntarily Lost 10 Pounds</h2><p>Last week, his wife <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Jenna Johnson</a> had to take him to emergency to get him checked up. There, Chmerkovskiy was “loaded with fluids” as well as IVs. Fortunately, as stated by Johnson in his June 19 Instagram story, the DWTS pro is “feeling so much better.”</p><p>“He is doing great today,” she wrote. “Basically what had happened… he was violently ill for three whole days. And by violently ill I mean, could not eat first of all, puked more than I’ve ever seen anybody in my life throw up. It was insane. All while doing four shows this past weekend.”</p><p>Subsequently, Johnson posted a video of a meal that she and her husband shared. The clip shows Chmerkovskiy sitting at a table with a plate of bacon and eggs in front of him.</p><p>“Nothing like losing 10 lbs in three days,” she wrote.</p><p>Unluckily, Chmerkovskiy had to celebrate his first ever <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Father’s Day</a> in the hospital. Describing the situation as an “adventure,” Johnson paid tribute to him via Instagram stories, which her husband shared in his personal account.</p><p>“I’m all good!” he wrote. “Thank you to everyone that came out to see us today! I gave it everything I got. Now just need to get some back.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-jenna-johnson-chmerkovskiy-brothers-will-perform-as-a-trio-for-the-first-time>Jenna Johnson, Chmerkovskiy Brothers Will Perform as a Trio for the First Time</h2><p>On June 23, Johnson announced that she, Val, and Maks Chmerkovskiy will be performing together in <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Savor After Hours</a>. The said residency is spearheaded by the two siblings and is described as “a wine-tasting cabaret reinvented for Napa nightlife.”</p><p>“Never before have the 3 of us taken the stage together like this,” she wrote. “Excited is an understatement, and we hope to see a lot of you there!!!!”</p><p>In the comment section, Maks wrote “LETS GO FAM!!!” to hype up their followers. Indeed, fans are thrilled to know that the three will be on the same stage together.</p><p>“Amazing. If that is not the luckiest crowd in the world to be able to see you perform with Maks and Val!” one person wrote. “So wish I could be there. Break a leg queen.”</p><p>“Now I’m waiting to see Peta join the three of you on stage!!!” another fan commented.</p><p>During the past week, Maks had to leave Napa Valley as his wife Peta Murgatroyd had to be in labor. The couple <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">welcomed their second son, Rio</a>, the latest addition to the Chmerkovskiy family.&nbsp;</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Original_ChaseStokes_KelseaBallerini_Jeff-KravitzGetty-Images-for-CMT-220x147.jpeg alt="We Officially Can’t Get Over How Cute Kelsea Ballerini, Chase Stokes Are" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57w7CrrGWgp7xuwsClZJygnZq%2FrLvVrKKisV2hvLSx0mZoaWWgpMKvsNJmmJ%2Bslad6o7HIp55mrpmkuaa606WwZquZmLhw</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JazzVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
