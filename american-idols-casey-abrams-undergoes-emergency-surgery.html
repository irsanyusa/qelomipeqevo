He says to the camera, “Hey, what’s up? I just got my colon out, and I miss the upright bass, but this’ll do.” He then strums on a guitar.</p><p>As Abrams captioned his post, “Bad news: I had my entire colon removed. Good news: I don’t have ulcerative colitis anymore.” He added that he went to the hospital four times. On the fourth visit, Abrams “was bleeding so much that I had to have an emergency surgery to save my life.”</p><p>The singer shared that a month has now passed, and he’s “recovering nicely,” although he still has one or two surgeries ahead of him. He thanked the staff of Providence St. Joseph, as well as his parents and “everyone who reached out.”</p><p>“I will keep you updated but as of now, I’m starting to sing, make music and play my bass again,” Abrams told fans. The singer had previously shared that he was in the hospital <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener" class=broken_link>back in September</a>.</p><p class=has-text-align-center><strong>SEE ALSO:</strong> <strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">‘AMERICAN IDOL’ FINALE DUETS YOU PROBABLY FORGOT ABOUT</a></strong></p><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-abrams-has-been-open-about-ulcerative-colitis>Abrams Has Been Open About Ulcerative Colitis</h3><p>As <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Heavy</a> points out, Abrams has spoken about his experience with ulcerative colitis in the past. Back in 2011, when he was competing on American Idol, he had to miss a live results show due to receiving two blood transfusions.</p><p>After placing sixth on the talent show, Abrams told the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">L.A. Times</a> that ulcerative colitis is “really not talked about that much because you’re going to the bathroom 10 to 14 times a day during a flare-up and there’s blood and it’s kind of embarrassing.”</p><p>“But if you have it, you have to talk about it, you have to see a doctor,” Abrams continued. “When I was in college I had symptoms for two to three weeks–I was weak, and I couldn’t walk across campus without getting winded. I thought it was a bug–I had stomach cramps, I was getting more pale and I was losing lots of blood.”</p><p>The singer said he didn’t want UC to define him, adding, “I think it’s a part of me, a little obstacle I have to hurdle over every day, and I think that’s the way you have to look at it.”</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Loren-Allred-220x147.jpg alt="‘BGT’ Singer Loren Allred Celebrates 500,000 YouTube Subscribers" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <span class=title-post-tagcloud>Tags</span> <a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>American Idol</a><a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>Casey Abrams</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57wKacq6GTlrtutcOoo6xlk5bApsWMmpmrmZ2oera6w56poKeVqHqmucSrnp6mk656tMHRoJyrsV8%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JazzVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
