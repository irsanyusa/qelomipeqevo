From the earliest days of photochemical film for capture and projection to the modern era of <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>digital projectors</a>, cameras, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>sound</a>, visual effects and <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>distribution</a>, filmed entertainment’s 120-plus-year history is one of constant innovation, collaboration, standardization and growth.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">As it tries to right the ship after <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>lengthy dual strikes</a>, Hollywood is facing a whole new wave of disruption, this one caused by recent advances in artificial intelligence. AI technologies and tools are driving a more profound shift than the industry has ever seen — at least it feels that way.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">The entertainment business’ reaction in these early AI days is reminiscent of its history with past disruptions, as the tech prompts a heady dose of unbridled enthusiasm countered with fear, uncertainty and doubt (not to mention <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>copyright infringement</a> lawsuits).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-datawrapper wp-block-embed-datawrapper"></figure><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">While it’s uncertain whether Mark Twain actually said, “History doesn’t repeat itself, but it often rhymes,” the epigram is an appropriate lens through which to frame the industry’s current turbulence, as illustrated by some notable examples.&nbsp;</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m"><strong>Digital Cinema</strong>&nbsp;<br>When it became clear in the early 2000s that theatrical exhibition was going digital, the business need for a universal standard for digital film prints drove the major Hollywood studios to form <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>Digital Cinema Initiatives</a>. &nbsp;</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">The consortium worked with cinema technology providers and filmmakers in developing a voluntary technical specification to ensure that digital prints of suitable picture and sound quality could be played anywhere in the world, mirroring the industrywide 35mm film standard. The specification was standardized in the U.S. by the Society of Motion Picture and Television Engineers.&nbsp;</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Rewiring the global cinema technology platform had its challenges. Cinema’s tech leaders had to assert themselves in the international standards community to ensure the cinematic experience remained differentiated, elevated and not degraded to just a big TV screen.&nbsp;</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Thankfully, they prevailed through a global agreement at the International Organization for Standardization on the cinema-specific technical standards in use today. Those standards enabled further innovations such as improved stereoscopic 3D, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>higher brightness</a> and <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>high dynamic range</a> (HDR), each of which opened new revenue opportunities.&nbsp;</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m"><strong>Cloud-Based Production</strong>&nbsp;<br>The second major shift, which began in the mid-2010s and is still underway, is from physical, on-premises production tools to <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>cloud-based services</a> for all forms of production.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">That evolution ramped up with the remote production demands of the global pandemic and a <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>2019 whitepaper</a> titled “The Evolution of Media Creation: A 10-Year Vision for the Future of Media Production, Post and Creative Technologies,” published by MovieLabs, the R&D venture undertaken jointly by all of Hollywood’s major studios.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">MovieLabs took a leadership role by publishing key technical specifications and initiating a range of collaborative activities with industry partners on common technical practices for secure cloud-based workflows.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">The shift is expected to continue providing cost savings and increased production flexibility as well as new capabilities that often come with modernized infrastructure.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Notably, it also brings the industry into closer alignment with a few Big Tech companies for network, computing and storage capabilities.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m"><strong>Enter AI: The Great(est?) Disruption</strong>&nbsp;<br>Ironically, it is the Big Tech companies, plus a few others, that are providing the foundational AI technologies powering today’s extraordinary wave of innovation, with new startups and tools appearing on a weekly, and sometimes daily, basis.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">The <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>AI ecosystem</a> on which our industry will rely is more disruptive and expansive than anything we have faced before, likely involving state, federal and international regulatory oversight as well as new alliances, new turf wars and workforce development challenges.&nbsp;</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">The pace of technological advancement is more rapid than ever. When have we ever seen research offered so quickly and so directly to end-users, apparently without much in the way of traditional product management, testing or quality assurance in so many cases?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">The media and entertainment industry is doing a great job of <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>educating itself</a> through guilds, professional societies, conferences and trade shows. It is also active in <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>critical discussions</a> on if and how copyright law will adapt to AI training sets and whether generative AI tools will impact the copyrightability of new content.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Still, there are consequential conversations in forums establishing new technical foundations on which the sector will sit, with little to no creative technologist representation: U.S. government agencies <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>beyond the Copyright Office</a>, the United Nations’ <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>International Telecommunications Union</a> and competitive initiatives for content security and authentication, to name a few.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">There is also a 65-country-strong <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>standards committee</a> that has already published 34 foundational AI protocols covering terminology, risk management systems, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>ethical concerns</a> and more.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m"><strong>Seizing the Opportunity</strong>&nbsp;<br>Achieving a new equilibrium for Hollywood — one with profitable business models, stable supply chains and a <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>sustainable workforce</a> — requires, among other things, agreement on the technical framework.&nbsp;</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Successful technical standards emerge after recognizing common pain points among stakeholders, advancing to enlightened self-interest and cooperative collaboration on solutions that foster continued innovation.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">To be sure, the world of entertainment is facing economic and market challenges unrelated to AI. But this latest disruption presents an opportunity to elevate the industry to new heights.&nbsp;</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Clarifying the collective requirements for AI advancements will take both leadership and effort, but it’s the only way to position Hollywood for a future where tech, creativity and business continue to thrive together.&nbsp;</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Andy Maltz, founder and principal of media tech consultancy <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>General Intelligence</a>, has been navigating disruptive change in M&E for decades. He also serves as chair of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">ISO/TC 36 Cinematography</a>, the film industry’s international technical standards committee.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiukae2psDYZ5qopV%2BrtrF7x6ijpbGnpLylecyuqq1llJqzqrrEZpiiZaSasKm6yJyYpWWjqa6vsMCrm6xlpKR6p63CnmSfraSqv6Z5kGtqb2lgZYBxg44%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JazzVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
