We&nbsp;don’t know if&nbsp;that’s true, but it’s clear several success stories do&nbsp;not start in&nbsp;a&nbsp;conventional way. For some people, fame came knocking at&nbsp;their door in&nbsp;the least expected way. They were talented enough to&nbsp;take the opportunities as&nbsp;they came, with lots of&nbsp;enthusiasm, and today we&nbsp;can see the results on&nbsp;the screen.</p><p><strong>Bright Side</strong> wants to&nbsp;share with you a&nbsp;list of&nbsp;9&nbsp;celebrities to&nbsp;whom fame came as&nbsp;a&nbsp;happy accident.</p><p><h2>1. Matthew McConaughey ran into a&nbsp;producer at&nbsp;a&nbsp;diner.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/705/6ee/80f75c5f27a18779410757ce0e.jpg><p>The actor was at&nbsp;a&nbsp;point in&nbsp;his life where he&nbsp;was already interested in&nbsp;acting; he&nbsp;studied film in&nbsp;Australia, but didn’t know how to&nbsp;move forward. One day, his girlfriend at&nbsp;the time told him to&nbsp;go&nbsp;to&nbsp;a&nbsp;diner to&nbsp;celebrate the end of&nbsp;the semester. McConaughey wasn’t that interested, but eventually agreed to&nbsp;go. Coincidentally, Don Phillips, a&nbsp;well-known industry casting director, was <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>there</a> too.</p><p>The now Oscar winner decided to&nbsp;introduce himself and hang out with the producer. A&nbsp;few hours later, Phillips liked Matthew so&nbsp;much that he&nbsp;took him to&nbsp;meet Linklater, the director of&nbsp;a&nbsp;new project he&nbsp;was working&nbsp;on, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Dazed and Confused</i></a>. At&nbsp;first, Linklater saw him as&nbsp;too good-looking for the job, but McConaughey grew his hair and mustache, proving his determination. And that’s how he&nbsp;landed his first big screen role.</p><p><h2>2. Nick Jonas was scouted singing in&nbsp;a&nbsp;hairdresser’s shop.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/58b/049/1692fc5c16bbb725163683074f.jpg><p>Before the Jonas brothers became a&nbsp;Disney Channel icon, as&nbsp;a&nbsp;6-year-old in&nbsp;1999, <a href=# title="Nick Jonas" data-link=tag>Nick Jonas</a> had to&nbsp;join his mom to&nbsp;the <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>hairdresser</a>. While she was getting her hair done, Nick started singing. Coincidentally, an&nbsp;agent happened to&nbsp;be&nbsp;nearby and saw something in&nbsp;him. As&nbsp;a&nbsp;result, he&nbsp;was invited to&nbsp;appear in&nbsp;Broadway shows such as&nbsp;<i>Beauty and the Beast</i> and <i>Les Miserables</i>.</p><p>It&nbsp;was not until 2005 that the singer joined forces with his two brothers to&nbsp;create the band Jonas Brothers. Their ambition was to&nbsp;reach stardom and eventually have their own show and appear on&nbsp;the best albums charts in&nbsp;the United States.</p><p><h2>3. Natalie Portman told a&nbsp;talent scout, “I&nbsp;don’t want to&nbsp;be&nbsp;a&nbsp;model. I&nbsp;want to&nbsp;be&nbsp;an&nbsp;actress.”</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/2be/40f/cd6f6f57bfbcf7a9e7263a69c1.jpg><p>When she was 11, Natalie went to&nbsp;a&nbsp;pizzeria after her dance classes. An&nbsp;agent from Revlon was there, too, and he&nbsp;thought Portman was the perfect image for one of&nbsp;their products.</p><p>He&nbsp;tried to&nbsp;introduce her to&nbsp;modeling agents, but she <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>said</a>, “I&nbsp;don’t want to&nbsp;be&nbsp;a&nbsp;model. I&nbsp;want to&nbsp;be&nbsp;an&nbsp;actress,” and these people connected her with acting agents. And that was the beginning of&nbsp;a&nbsp;very successful career that includes prominent roles in&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Star Wars</i></a>, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Thor</i></a>, and <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>The Black Swan</i></a>, for which she won an&nbsp;Oscar.</p><p><h2>4. Keira Knightley was part of&nbsp;the cast because she resembled Natalie Portman.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/0ec/426/e234375c26870955d6957b0f58.jpg><p><h2>5. Chris Pine was not looking to&nbsp;be&nbsp;an&nbsp;actor, even though many of&nbsp;his relatives were.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/a0a/793/53273d554096a754c409d623ad.jpg><p>In&nbsp;an&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>interview</a>, Pine stated, “I&nbsp;don’t even feel like&nbsp;I chose this. I&nbsp;just started doing theater in&nbsp;college, and then&nbsp;I went to&nbsp;Los Angeles and got an&nbsp;agent. It’s something that rolled like a&nbsp;very slow snowball to&nbsp;where I&nbsp;am now. It’s very strange.” Still, we&nbsp;love his characters so&nbsp;much, and we’re grateful for his career.</p><p><h2>6. Anya Taylor-Joy was walking her dog.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/9d1/9e2/60fc6859f1994a70977a558198.jpg><p>One day, when the actress was&nbsp;16, she walked her dog in&nbsp;a&nbsp;park. Anya had a&nbsp;party to&nbsp;attend that night, where she would have to&nbsp;wear heels, so&nbsp;she <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>decided</a> to&nbsp;take a&nbsp;walk in&nbsp;those shoes. A&nbsp;black van started following her on&nbsp;her way back, which initially scared her. In&nbsp;an&nbsp;interview, she mentioned, “I&nbsp;thought ’Oh, there’s no&nbsp;way that car is&nbsp;following me,’ but it&nbsp;was. I&nbsp;started running, and this man stuck his head out the window and said, ’If you stop, you won’t regret it.’ Strangely, I&nbsp;did stop.”</p><p>The guy turned out to&nbsp;be&nbsp;a&nbsp;talent scout who invited her to&nbsp;work as&nbsp;a&nbsp;model, a&nbsp;path that led to&nbsp;acting. Still, let’s keep in&nbsp;mind that our safety comes first, and, as&nbsp;Anya did at&nbsp;the time, we&nbsp;must investigate that the information is&nbsp;accurate before accepting any offer from strangers.</p><p><h2>7. Heo Sung-Tae was “The King of&nbsp;TV&nbsp;Sales.”</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/328/3cf/65fe145ae6b22f5f93b46db94f.jpg><p>The actor of&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>The Squid Game</i></a> worked for a&nbsp;large company in&nbsp;marketing and was even nicknamed “The King of&nbsp;TV sales.” He&nbsp;became an&nbsp;actor because he&nbsp;once saw a&nbsp;commercial on&nbsp;TV called “Miracle Audition.” He&nbsp;applied to&nbsp;be&nbsp;a&nbsp;contestant in&nbsp;the show and was accepted, and, thanks to&nbsp;his great natural talent, he&nbsp;won fifth place.</p><p>He&nbsp;had not had a&nbsp;single acting experience before and not much interest in&nbsp;it&nbsp;either. The show’s judges praised his talent, which motivated him to&nbsp;start his career as&nbsp;an&nbsp;actor, learning to&nbsp;imitate comedians on&nbsp;television. In&nbsp;an&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>interview</a>, he&nbsp;mentioned: “I&nbsp;became an&nbsp;actor because the judges complimented&nbsp;me. If&nbsp;a&nbsp;single judge had told me&nbsp;I wasn’t good, I&nbsp;wouldn’t have become an&nbsp;actor”.</p><p><h2>8. Mandy Moore was spotted by&nbsp;a&nbsp;parcel delivery employee.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/1b9/a2f/ce04345e46bf71de76b8ace50e.jpg><p>At&nbsp;13, Mandy Moore knew she wanted to&nbsp;be&nbsp;a&nbsp;musician and was in&nbsp;an&nbsp;Orlando studio recording a&nbsp;demo. At&nbsp;that moment, a&nbsp;delivery man arrived to&nbsp;deliver an&nbsp;order and <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>overheard</a> her. Luckily for Moore, this man had a&nbsp;friend working at&nbsp;one of&nbsp;the biggest record labels in&nbsp;the world, and he&nbsp;told him about her. Word spread until the singer and actress signed a&nbsp;contract with the company.</p><p><h2>9. Billie Eilish recorded <i>Ocean Eyes</i> for her dance instructor</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/117/f20/d9f61550b8a54c8411432fa2cd.jpg><p>When she was&nbsp;13, her dance teacher asked her to&nbsp;write a&nbsp;song for a&nbsp;choreographed dance. With the help of&nbsp;her brother, Eilish <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>recorded</a> <i>Ocean Eyes</i>, which she uploaded to&nbsp;the popular music streaming site <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>SoundCloud</a>. The surprise came when, the next day, she discovered that her song was already viral. The rest is&nbsp;history.</p><p>Have any accidents led you to&nbsp;unexpected, amazing accomplishments?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZIZur8SlnJuqmam2pr%2BMsJ%2BoZZiWsW6706Gcq2Wgoa6vv4ybrK1llpbBpnnBq6aun5iperW0xKZkraddqbWmtdFmq6utlWK9osDHZm9pcGVlgHA%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JazzVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
