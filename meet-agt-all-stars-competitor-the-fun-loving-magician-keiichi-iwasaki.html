Here’s everything you need to know about this lively and fun-loving magician who’s a Britain’s Got Talent alum.</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-who-is-keiichi-iwasaki>Who is Keiichi Iwasaki?</h2><p>The Japanese magician is a traveler and performer who left his home country over twenty years ago to pursue his dreams. He left Japan in 2001 aged 28 and has been cycling on many countries and performing in many shows.</p><p>Together with his trusty bicycle, he’s been performing as a street magician to support his needs while traveling. Iwasaki is a compassionate man, throughout his journey he’s looking for ways how he could make the world better. Iwasaki joined an international expedition team in 2005 and scaled Mount Everest, which is 8848 meters high.</p><p>“When I climbed Mount Everest, I climbed with 17 members and many Sherpa (mountain guides), so they made the route,” Iwasaki said. “They also fixed a line for us and it made it easier to climb. But on Mount Blanc, I climbed completely alone.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-he-is-a-golden-buzzer-receiver-on-bgt>He is a Golden Buzzer Receiver on BGT</h2><p>Keiichi Iwasaki performed on <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">BGT</a> series 15 and amazed the judges and audience with his stunning performance. He did a chopstick trick where he pushed it into his mouth and nose and then pulled it out. Iwasaki also made a set of cards and a ring levitate without any visible strings or attachments.</p><p>His performance amazed the judges, who gave him three yeses. Ant and Dec raced onto the stage and hit their Golden Buzzer for him before their fourth yes. They moved him to the Quarter Finals, where he amazed everyone once more and went to the Semi-Finals. Unfortunately, he did not get past that round and was eliminated.</p><p>Iwasaki is no stranger to performing on the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Got Talent</a> stage though, he competed in Spain’s Got Talent in 2018, making it all the way to the grand finale. He also competed on Bulgaria’s Got Talent in May 2021, reaching the finals. He competed on Germany’s Got Talent in December 2021, reaching the finals and finishing seventh.</p><p>This year, he is competing on AGT All Stars hoping for the win, and achieve his goal of gaining the coveted trophy. Keiichi has over 14 thousand Instagram followers and frequently posts about his magic tricks as well as videos of himself performing.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Original_RuPaulCharles_Charles-Sykes_Bravo-via-Getty-Images-220x147.jpg alt="RuPaul Calls Himself a ‘Good Kisser,’ Remembers His First Kiss" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57zJ6crWWRnMFurculZKyskafAbq%2FOpqeerJmpvLN506GcZp6lo3qtu9WipaBlnZa0qq%2FImqVmo5WetqS0yGagsJmjlriqew%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JazzVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
