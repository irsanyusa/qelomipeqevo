To gain ownership of half of the late dancer’s estate, Holker has filed a spousal property petition.</p><p>The petition is standard procedure for a situation like this, and was filed at the Superior Court of California in Los Angeles. Though California law states that a surviving spouse has rights to their deceased spouse’s half of their joint estate, the living spouse must file the petition to prove that they are the spouse of the deceased.</p><p>In addition to half of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Boss</a>‘ estate, Holker’s petition, if approved, will grant her permission to all of Boss’ assets, including TV royalties. Holker is requesting for the undivided one-half interest of her late husband’s company, Stephen Boss Productions and Goldman Sachs investment account. Other assets include: Cast and Crew Production Services; Disney Worldwide Services, Inc.; GEP Talent Services, LLC; and SAG/AFTRA.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Allison Holker Said Boss Had “No Money” When They Met</h2><p>The late <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">SYTYCD</a> star has amassed more than five million dollars when he died in 2022. Holker has revealed that wasn’t always the case, as when they met in 2013, Boss apparently had no money saved up. Holker met Boss before he landed a job as a DJ on The Ellen DeGeneres show in 2014, stated that he “only owned personal effects of little value.”</p><p>She was a contestant on SYTYCD in season two and returned as an all-star dancer in season seven, where she met Boss. The couple, who married in 2013, welcomed their first child, a son named Maddox Laurel, in March 2016. In November 2019, their family grew with the arrival of their second child, a daughter named Zaia.</p><p>Celebrity Net Worth reports that tWitch made $500,000 per season during her first two seasons on The Ellen DeGeneres Show, indicating that the duo appeared to be thriving together.
