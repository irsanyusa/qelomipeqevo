The book is revered, believed in some cases to possess magical powers and is also regarded as the law.</strong></p><p>Many will however be shocked by some verses of scripture in the Bible that they have not come across before. Here they are:</p><p class=h4>1. Deuteronomy 25:11</p><p>This Bible verse is weird, funny and kind of scary.&nbsp;Deuteronomy 25:11 says:</p><p><i>"When two men are fighting and the wife of one of them intervenes to drag her husband clear of his opponent, if she puts out her hand and catches hold of the man by his privates, you must cut off her hand and show her no mercy."</i></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/vllkyt6joh0ss6kvb.jpg><p class=h4>2. Psalms 137:9</p><p>This Bible verse is confusing and scary at the same time. It says: <i>"Happy is the one who seizes your infants and dashes them against the rocks."</i></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/vllkyt37u1jhp2ibp.jpg><p class=h4>3. 2 Kings 2: 23 - 24</p><p>Elijah was obviously in a bad mood here, no other way to explain it.&nbsp;2 Kings 2: 23 - 24 says: <i>"And he went up from thence unto Bethel: and as he was going up by the way, there came forth little children out of the city, and mocked him, and said unto him, Go up, thou bald head; go up, thou bald head.&nbsp;</i></p><p><i>"And he turned back, and looked on them, and cursed them in the name of the Lord. And there came forth two she bears out of the wood, and tare forty and two children of them."</i></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/vllkyt60gpkee1scs.jpg><p><strong>READ ALSO</strong>:&nbsp;People Criticize Bible Verses Thinking Theyâ€™re From Quran</p><p class=h4>4. Leviticus 18:22</p><p>Homosexuality is spelled out as a sin clearly in this Bible verse: Leviticus 18:22 <i>"You shall not lie with a male as with a woman; it is an abomination."</i></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/vllkyt47mr3b5i44o.jpg><p>5. There was a nudist here, why he was running around remains unclear. Mark 14: 51,52 has this to say:<i> "And a young man followed [Jesus], with nothing but a linen cloth about his body. And they seized him, but he left the linen cloth and ran away naked."&nbsp;</i>Many believe the naked man was Mark.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/vllkytlqghejgh87s.jpg><p class=h4>6. 1 Peter 2:18</p><p>On the matter of slavery, the Bible had these to say, at 1 Peter 2: 18: <i>"Slaves, in reverent fear of God submit yourselves to your masters, not only to those who are good and considerate, but also to those who are harsh."</i></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/vllkyt3kaadrnb2gu.jpg><p><strong>READ ALSO:</strong>&nbsp;4 bible verses to know for when your husband cheats on you</p><p class=h4>7. Jeremiah 19:9</p><p>Cannibalism? This Bible verse proclaims some scary things. Jeremiah 19:9 says: <i>"I will make them eat the flesh of their sons and daughters, and they will eat one another's flesh because their enemies will press the siege so hard against them to destroy them."</i></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/vllkyt396am86h9leg.jpg><p>Source: Legit.ng</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rbHGoqtnppdkfnF9k3Fra2VnYsCpu8KkoKefXZe2o7jEZq2eqqOawG7Fzq5ksKGcoXqvsdWeqWaalaG2psLEZpirnV2WsLXBwKWjsmWZo3q1tMRmmaKanJp7qcDMpQ%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JazzVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
