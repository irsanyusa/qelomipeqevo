He&nbsp;told that their <a href=# title=family data-link=tag>family</a> went through 2&nbsp;major losses in&nbsp;a&nbsp;short period of&nbsp;time. And when it&nbsp;seemed that there’s nothing that could add to&nbsp;their sorrow, a&nbsp;next-door neighbor showed up&nbsp;and started producing shocking claims. He&nbsp;wanted a&nbsp;copy of&nbsp;the man’s grandma’s will, and his appetites were only growing bigger.</p><p><h2>The OP’s family has recently had a&nbsp;big loss.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/e62/356/e4e3e7501297c46dfef73acb77.jpg><p>A&nbsp;man took to&nbsp;Reddit, telling his <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>story</a>, and he&nbsp;didn’t even try to&nbsp;hide his emotions. He&nbsp;started his post, saying that he&nbsp;recently lost his grandmother. She was diagnosed with cancer, she opted for no&nbsp;treatment. She had watched her husband go&nbsp;through chemo, radiation and surgery, and he&nbsp;was miserable the whole time.</p><p>She didn’t want that for herself. Her family supported her. Over the next year, she gifted items to&nbsp;family and friends; told all members of&nbsp;her family to&nbsp;write their names on&nbsp;the things they want, take what they wanted, etc.</p><p>There were conditions: No, you can’t have that, it’s a&nbsp;family heirloom meant to&nbsp;go&nbsp;to&nbsp;Aunt and her kids; or&nbsp;to&nbsp;Dad and his kids. The whole family knew what those items were and who they were going&nbsp;to, so&nbsp;that was easily settled after she died.</p><p><h2>After a&nbsp;big loss, another one was on&nbsp;their doorstep.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/81a/c50/deb42151e09da075385db94539.jpg><p>The man <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>wrote</a>, “The house was inherited by&nbsp;my&nbsp;father, who very suddenly and unexpectedly passed away two weeks later. I&nbsp;inherited the house at&nbsp;that point.”</p><p>The family hasn’t fully recovered from their grief, when an&nbsp;appalling case happened to&nbsp;them. The man described&nbsp;it, writing, “The next door neighbor (we’ll call him Todd) came over several times, upset that he&nbsp;and his kids (21F, 19M) weren’t invited to&nbsp;Grandma’s funeral (there wasn’t one, we&nbsp;were all too busy reeling from my&nbsp;father’s death), weren’t presented with a&nbsp;copy of&nbsp;the will (it&nbsp;only included family members) and he&nbsp;KNEW Grandma loved his kids like her own.”</p><p>The OP&nbsp;then clarified that, in&nbsp;fact, his grandma didn’t love the neighbor’s kids. She complained about them coming over all the time, stealing her water to&nbsp;fill their pool, and she had to&nbsp;tell them to&nbsp;stop calling her Grandma. Their neighbor wanted to&nbsp;know if&nbsp;the&nbsp;OP would allow his kids to&nbsp;go&nbsp;through the house to&nbsp;see if&nbsp;there was anything they’d like to&nbsp;take to&nbsp;remember her&nbsp;by.</p><p><h2>The neighbor’s claims and wishes were simply impudent.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/731/b44/de7b3d5fd08883e4e191d7b20a.jpg><p>The OP&nbsp;continues, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>saying</a>, “I&nbsp;thought he&nbsp;was awfully rude, but&nbsp;I offered to&nbsp;let them go&nbsp;through the boxes&nbsp;I had packed that&nbsp;I was planning to&nbsp;donate, and he&nbsp;was offended!! I&nbsp;mean, mortified!! He&nbsp;said his daughter and son had their hearts set on&nbsp;some items that were family heirlooms, and&nbsp;I literally laughed at&nbsp;him.</p><p>I&nbsp;explained they were family heirlooms and would be&nbsp;staying with&nbsp;me, and two of&nbsp;the items had already gone home with my&nbsp;brother. He&nbsp;said, ’My kids were her family and she would have gifted those to&nbsp;them. They should have been included along with everyone else when everything was divided up.’”</p><p>OP&nbsp;mentioned that none of&nbsp;them knew this guy or&nbsp;his kids other than “the neighbors next door”. They were never at&nbsp;any family gatherings that were held at&nbsp;their house, and the only time he&nbsp;ever heard grandma talk about them was when she was complaining about them. Especially when she caught them using BOTH her hoses to&nbsp;fill up&nbsp;their pool and then came over complaining because she had put locks on&nbsp;the outdoor faucets!</p><p><h2>The OP&nbsp;couldn’t believe that such things might even happen to&nbsp;them.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/718/818/5ea6a654a58dd228feb8e09f8a.jpg><p>In&nbsp;the end of&nbsp;their post, the man made some additional <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>clarifications</a> about the whole story. He&nbsp;wrote that this happened a&nbsp;little over 10&nbsp;years ago. They were all prepared for Grandma’s passing and while they were sad, his dad’s passing was unexpected and absolutely devastating.</p><p>Todd brought up&nbsp;the subject three times in&nbsp;the year he&nbsp;lived next door, all within about 2&nbsp;weeks. This particular incident was the end of&nbsp;it. The first two times were eyebrow raising hints where the&nbsp;OP walked away not really sure if&nbsp;he&nbsp;was interpreting his words correctly.</p><p>This time he&nbsp;was brazenly clear and when the&nbsp;OP laughed and told him he&nbsp;couldn’t have the items he&nbsp;listed, he&nbsp;never brought it&nbsp;up&nbsp;again. Luckily, Todd’s house was in&nbsp;foreclosure and he&nbsp;moved away about a&nbsp;year later.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/9ae/ea0/4ef2065222bcc04d8d928b6df4.jpg><p>And here’re 13&nbsp;stories from people who have such <a href=#>neighbors</a> that they wouldn’t wish even for their enemies to&nbsp;have them.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZK6vecSnq6KsnJqxbrrEop6hmp%2BnerTBw52cp6SpYsSiutOsZJplk6S9unnOn2SmsV2cv6K6w6aYrGWnnrmtecCnm2adppq7brnOq5xmcGFsgnaBjg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JazzVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
