Malinois - intelligence and strong temperament</h3></p><span class=image-holder data-fancybox=images-42cd1e4d-09f3-4c11-b35e-f83676a12d48 data-caption="A Belgian Malinois trained to attack [Hannah Fowler/Insider]"><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ocdn.eu/pulscms-transforms/1/5LMktkuTURBXy80N2VmZDU3Mi1kMmE3LTQwMjgtYjJlMS01NWEyNDFkNWQwNWMuanBlZ5KVAwAAzQiuzQaClQLNAxbNAlHCww></span><p>The Malinois is known for its extraordinary intelligence and willingness to work. In the past, it was used as a shepherd dog to herd sheep - nowadays it is often trained in the army, police, and even anti-terrorist units, which proves its extraordinary abilities and predispositions.</p><p>In many cases, instead of tracking down bad guys, this lively canine genius often has to settle for eight hours on the couch. The lack of opportunity to develop its extraordinary predispositions can definitely affect the mental well-being of our pet.</p><p><h3 class="heading-h3 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-9>2. Labrador - duck tracking champion</h3></p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><span class=image-holder data-fancybox=images-ca88ad86-4606-4c6b-b3bd-b6a9e6b8d426 data-caption="A Labrador is not happy sitting at home all day, seriously overweight [BI USA]"><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ocdn.eu/pulscms-transforms/1/RqwktkuTURBXy81Zjg1Y2IzYS00M2Y0LTRiODAtYmVlMy0wNDIzMTdjODBjYzQuanBlZ5KVAwAAzQgkzQYblQLNAxbNAlHCww></span><p>Are you fed up with the fact that your beautiful, biscuity Labrador won't miss any opportunity to roll in every puddle it encounters? Maybe you're trying to discipline him for it? It is worth remembering that humans selected this breed specifically for bringing back shot ducks.</p><p>Therefore, it is in the nature of a Labrador to love water, swimming and fetching. That's when he's happy - not when he's sitting at home all day, seriously overweight.</p><p><h3 class="heading-h3 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-13>3. Akita Inu - bear dog</h3></p><span class=image-holder data-fancybox=images-aeb273ac-d576-448d-8aa6-4b8a54b10822 data-caption="Akita Inu is an exceptionally brave dog breed [American Kennel Club]"><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ocdn.eu/pulscms-transforms/1/Y5hktkpTURBXy8xYjBkMzhjYjJjOWRkNGZhZjk2Zjk1YjExYTBhNTcxYi5qcGeSlQMAAM0CWM0BkJUCzQJYzQGQwsM></span><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>Akita Inu is a warrior born, or rather created through genetic manipulation. Breeders selected it because they needed an animal useful for hunting large game, including bears. It can therefore be assumed that it must be an exceptionally brave dog. If we are looking for a docile and gentle dog, this will not be a good choice for obvious reasons.</p><p><h3 class="heading-h3 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-16>4. Yorkshire Terrier - rat killer</h3></p><span class=image-holder data-fancybox=images-a30dc1bf-dcb9-4d65-b40c-715a31615a94 data-caption="Yorkshire Terriers tend to be treated like toys [Daily Paws]"><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ocdn.eu/pulscms-transforms/1/HoektkpTURBXy80ZDRiYWJkNjBjMjIzZDFmYTJiZGQ2ODliZGYyMzQzYS5qcGeSlQMAAM0F3M0D6JUCzQMWzQIPwsM></span><p>Due to their small size, Yorkies were used for catching rats in mines, not for carrying in a purse. Unfortunately, nowadays some owners forget that dogs of this breed are not toys and can and even need to walk on their own.<strong> </strong>The inability to satisfy their natural needs often leads to stagnation or excessive nervousness in this breed.</p><p><h3 class="heading-h3 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-19>5. Husky - a dog for special tasks</h3></p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><span class=image-holder data-fancybox=images-712af695-4167-4355-9c5c-5ba9ed3dfab4 data-caption="Husky dogs can do a lot [Pet Keen]"><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ocdn.eu/pulscms-transforms/1/L9KktkpTURBXy8yZTllY2QyNGMzZWYwMmQwMDY5NTY3YzhiYmM2M2QyZS5qcGeSlQMAAM0DKs0CHJUCzQMWzQIPwsM></span><p>It is widely known that the husky in its natural habitat was used to pull sleds across vast areas of tundra. However, it is also worth remembering that it was used for extreme tasks.</p><p>In 1925, a sled pulled by dogs of this breed travelled over a thousand kilometers at temperatures below 50 degrees Celsius to deliver the serum needed to stop the diphtheria epidemic in Alaska. These dogs can do a lot.</p><p>Currently, they often live in limited spaces, often in blocks of flats, and are taken for two half-hour walks a day, which easily leads to frustration and excess energy, which can be released, for example, by digging holes in the ground.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>Many dog ​​owners may not realise how important it is to adapt their dog's living conditions to its heritage and instincts. Understanding the needs and natural behaviors of your breed can help you ensure your dog lives a happy and healthy life.</p><p>This article was originally published on <a href=# id=8aa95a38-0ff4-4c84-aa95-5d789079e613 data-link-role-code=open_new_tab>Onet Woman</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7scHLrJxnppdkuaqyxKyrsqSVZLOzwdKtqZqslZl6pbvGZpmrnZWZwHB%2B2amcnptm</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JazzVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
