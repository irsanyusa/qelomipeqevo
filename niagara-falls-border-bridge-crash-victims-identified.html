Villani and Monica Villani, both 53, of Grand Island, a suburb on the Niagara River between Buffalo and Niagara Falls.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Online business records and the company website indicate the victims’ family owns Gui’s Lumber and seven Ace Hardware locations in western New York, his family operating the business since the mid-1980s.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“We would like to extend our sincere gratitude to all that extended prayers, condolences and well wishes," the families and the lumber company said in a joint statement released by the Erie County Sheriff’s Office on Friday. “At this point, we are requesting privacy so we may begin the process of healing.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The wreck prompted widespread concern on both sides of the border, as video and images of what appeared to be the aftermath of an explosion began to circulate online and officials closed the bridge and three other nearby crossings. Authorities investigated for several hours before the FBI's Buffalo office said it found no signs of a terror attack and turned the case over to local police as a traffic investigation.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The president of the Grand Island Chamber of Commerce said Friday that the couple's support for their community was well known.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“They gave from their heart, so they didn’t make a big deal about it,” Eric Fiebelkorn said.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Mike Billoni was with Niagara Frontier Publications in 2014 when he photographed Kurt P. Villani and his son, Kurt Jr., as they dropped off a load of turkeys for a local food drive.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The Villanis were carrying on an annual tradition of donating 250 turkeys begun six years earlier by the older Villani’s parents, Kurt and Gail Villani, Billoni wrote in a news story at the time.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“It was such a wonderful gesture to see the philanthropy of the father passed on to the son, who then passed it down to his son,” Billoni recalled Friday. It was unclear whether the tradition continued.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The eldest Villani died last year, leaving a void in the close-knit business community that has now grown with the loss of the son, Fiebelkorn said.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The Niagara Falls Police Department has said the crash investigation will take time given the complexity.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">New York Gov. Kathy Hochul has described it as “surreal” and said the vehicle was “basically incinerated” with nothing left but the engine and a scattering of charred debris.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“You actually had to look at it and say, was this generated by AI?” Hochul, a Democrat, said at a news conference Wednesday. “Because it was so surreal to see. How high in the air this vehicle went, and then the crash, and the explosion, and the fire.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">About 6,000 vehicles cross the Rainbow Bridge each day, according to the U.S. Federal Highway Administration’s National Bridge Inventory. The short, steel bridge offers scenic views of Niagara Falls.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmZva2NugnmBjqegmp%2BRp65ussClo6xlkqS%2FpbHRZpmroZScsm6v0ZqqoWWmnrC1tcysZKKclaPBqrLInpto</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JazzVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
