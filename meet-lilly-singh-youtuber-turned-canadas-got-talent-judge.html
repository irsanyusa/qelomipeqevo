Before being announced as one of the celebrity judges, she was known and loved as a comedian. Meet Lilly Singh, YouTube star turned Canada‚Äôs Got Talent Judge.</strong></p><p>If you‚Äôve ever clicked on a YouTube video and heard ‚Äúwhat up everyone it‚Äôs your girl superwoman‚Äù you know exactly who she is. Singh began her Youtube channel in 2010 under the pseudonym IISuperwomanII based off of a childhood idea that made her believe she could do anything. A year later, she created Superwoman vlogs that featured daily chronicles and behind the scenes of her comedy content.</p><p>A year later she made her film debut in the 2014 Bollywood film, Dr. Cabbie. During this time, her channel ranked at No. 39 on New Media Rockstars Top 100 Channels. Later that year she received nominations for a Shorty Award and a Streamy Award. This was truly only the beginning of Singh‚Äôs career, she went on to win plenty of other awards.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-singh-drops-superwoman-label-after-nine-years-begins-posting-as-lilly>Singh Drops Superwoman Label After Nine Years, Begins Posting As Lilly</h2><p>This YouTube star became so big that she embarked on her ‚ÄúA Trip to Unicorn Island‚Äù world tour. Within each show she adapted her YouTube content (which included singing, dancing, music performances, comedy, and her parent characters) for a stage performance. The tour went to India, Australia, Hong Kong, Singapore, Dubai, Canada, Trinidad and Tobago, The U.K. and The U.S. She documented her tour in her first feature movie of the same name.</p><p>Soon after her tour, she was named to People Magazine‚Äôs ‚ÄúOnes to Watch‚Äù list. On top of that she won two Teen Choice Awards from three nominations. Since 2016, she‚Äôs taken one the world by publishing a book, gaining more acting roles, and more. In 2018, she launched her own production company, Unicorn Island Productions.</p><p>From there, Singh was given the opportunity to host a late night talk show, A Little Late with Lilly Singh. It was around this time that Singh dropped her online persona and began posting under her given name. In 2019, she dropped the name Superwoman and began posting as Lilly.</p><p>Even after dropping her YouTube alias, Singh has continued her successful career. Her late night show was on tv for two seasons. After her talk show ended, she signed on to a comedy project with Netflix and will be apart of the second season of Hulu‚Äôs <a href=#>Dollface</a>. On March 22, 2022, Singh will sit next to Howie Mandel as one of the celebrity judges of Canada‚Äôs Got Talent.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>She is Always Authentically Herself, Even if it May Pose a Career Risk</h2><p>Outside of her career, Singh is quite the advocate. She showed support during the George Floyd protests, was featured in a Presidential campaign fundraiser, and has expressed support for the 2020-2021 Indian farmers protest. She‚Äôs always been one to share what she believes in, even if there is risk involved.</p><p>Singh was the first of many who publicly shared their sexual identity on YouTube. While some may have seen this as a career risk, Singh was welcomed into the LGBTQ+ community with open arms. Other YouTube stars like Shane Dawson, Hannah Hart, and Manny Mua shared their support for her.</p><p>Singh became popular on YouTube near the beginning of its popularity and defintely was one of the most memorable stars. To this day I still know the introduction to her videos. Although she doesn‚Äôt still go by Superwoman, she really still wears the name. She skyrocketed to fame and has handled it extremely well ever since.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><p lang=en dir=ltr>‚úÖ Female<br>‚úÖ Coloured<br>‚úÖ Bisexual</p><p>Throughout my life these have proven to be obstacles from time to time.
