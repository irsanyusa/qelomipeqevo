After various years of admiring one another abilities, and being absolute friend goals, the two decided to work together on a brand new song “Who We Love.” The song is finally out, and we cannot stop hitting repeat.</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-who-we-love-is-a-beautiful-classic-love-song>“Who We Love” is a “Beautiful Classic Love Song”</h2><p>Former The Voice Mega Mentor, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Sheeran</a> and Smith just released their first collaboration song “Who We Love.” The seamless blending of their voices makes “Who We Love,” what you may anticipate from both artists, with an added surprise. We really needed it, and it’s giving fans of the singers or love songs in general, a great tune to listen to.</p><p>“It was beautiful. We’ve been friends for a long time and we’ve always wanted to work on a piece of music together. And this happened just so naturally,” Smith said. “I love the record so much and he is such a dear special person to me, and to share something like this, it’s the end of the album and everything feels so perfect about it. I love it.”</p><p>The two have performed together in the past, but “Who We Love,” is their first ever official collaboration on a track. The song is featured on Smith’s newest album Gloria and is the final track of the 13 song album. Smith’s new album Gloria has a star-studded cast of musicians in addition to Sheeran, including Canadian Jessie Reyez and Kim Petras.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Ed Sheeran Sings For Courteney Cox</h2><p>Another close friend of Sheeran, is actress Courteney Cox whom he sang for in their most recent Instagram collaboration.
