In her recent appearance in The Drew Barrymore Show, Trainor explains how she sparked romance with her now husband.</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-meghan-trainor-fangirled-over-daryl-sabara-before>Meghan Trainor Fangirled Over Daryl Sabara Before</h2><p>Apparently, the “Made You Look” singer first encountered Sabara when she was still starting in Hollywood. Way back, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Trainor</a> attended a songwriter party that Sabara coincidentally crashed with his friends. Recalling this moment, Trainor said that she fangirled heavily when the moment she saw the Spy Kids actor.</p><p>“I went like right to him I was ‘Are you Spy Kids?’ and he was like ‘Yeah’ and it was really nice,” she <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">said</a>.</p><p>According to the singer, approaching Sabara was unusual for her because she normally doesn’t say anything as a fangirl. Little did she know, that cute encounter was the beginning of her love story.</p><p>“Two years later, I became a famous pop star and I was friends with Chloe Moretz,” she said. “I was like ‘I want a nice guy, I just I’m sick of all these mean guys I want a nice guy.'”</p><p>Acting matchmaker and doing it successfully, Chloe Moretz invited Trainor and Sabara for a double date, and the love magic just happened. Since then, the two have “never been apart.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>She Talks About Motherhood, Body Positivity</h2><p>A couple of years after they got married, Trainor and Sabara welcomed their first born, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Riley</a>. This milestone in Trainor’s life inspired her to create more music amid motherly responsibilities.</p><p>“Luckily, I produce and record my vocals myself, so I do a lot of work at my house,” she said. “I built a studio in my basement and then I told my co-writers like we can start at 10 a.m. but I’m wrapped by 6 p.m. because I’m there for a bath time and bedtime.”</p><p>Trainor’s creative process has much to do with voicing out what other women are scared to speak about. Reflecting on her smash hit “Me Too,” the pop star said that she composed it while feeling unconfident. Nevertheless, she proceeded to do so because she needs to be comforted by the lyrics.</p><p>“I’m working everyday, I’m trying to better myself and trying to love myself more,” she said. “That’s what these songs are about,” she said.</p><p>Now, she intends to empower as a mom. Trainor recently released her newest studio album, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Takin’ It Back</a>, rediscovering self-love and maturity. Fans have playfully been vibing with this new collection.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Original_DWTS_JudgesHalloweenNight_ABC_Eric-McCandless.jpg alt="‘DWTS’ is Gearing Up for ’90s Night, Return of Relays — Here’s What to Expect" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <span class=title-post-tagcloud>Tags</span> <a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>Daryl Sabara</a><a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>Meghan Trainor</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57x56pnqtdnby4ecyenqGZnmLBs63Ip6arZZaev7TAjKacrWWYmr9utNSsmZqmlGKxor7YpWSsmZKWv6J7</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JazzVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
