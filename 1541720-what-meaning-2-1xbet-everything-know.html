In total betting, the punter stakes on any number of countable events that happen during the match.</p><strong>Win big with our exclusive over 2 odds. <a id="https://apps.apple.com/US/app/id844035425?mt=8" href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Click here</a> to place your bet on todayâ€™s matches.</strong><p class=align-left>So, what does a total over 2 means? A bettor wagering on a total over 2 means they expect the countable number of events that will happen during the match to be two or more.</p><p class=align-left>Although this type of betting involves all events expected to occur during the match, most people only focus on the number of goals hence, the popularity of over 2 bettings.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/c8b26b42bad0c8be.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Bet9ja promo code: Full list and their meanings (updated for 2024)</span></p></a><p class=align-left>It is also vital to note that total bets are not only meant for the entire game. Gamblers can also set their bets on specific periods like halves, quarters, or even 5-minute periods.</p><h3>What does over 2 goals mean in 1xBet?</h3><p class=align-left>Generally, over 2 goals is a betting trick that predicts the total number of goals scored during the match to be more than two. In this case, all goals scored by opponents, including their own goals, are counted.</p><p class=align-left>For example, if the total number of goals counted after the final whistle is 3 or 4, the punter wins the bet. However, any number below 2 is a loss, while a total of 2 goals will have the bettor refunded their staking amount.</p><h3>What is the difference between over 2.5 and over 2?</h3><p class=align-left>The primary difference between over 2 and over 2.5 is the outcome of the match and how the bookmaker sets its winning or losing markets. For instance, over 2 is a three-way winning market that allows bettors to win, lose, or get refunded if the final goal count is 2.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/d0ecbdff066d3136.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=28><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Booking on Bet9ja: codes, app usage and tips for bettors in 2024</span></p></a><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/039012d95b5c6910.jpg><p class=align-left>Contrary, over 2.5 is a two-way market that allows punters to lose or win the bet if the total number of goals is below or above 2, respectively.</p><p class=align-left>Therefore, while the meaning of over 2 in 1xBet is closely related to that of over 2.5, it is crucial to understand why <a href=#>betting platforms</a> choose to use half goal and not just a full goal.</p><strong>Step into the world of online betting and explore 1xBet main page for a comprehensive selection of sports, live betting, and virtual games. <a id="https://1xbet.co.ke/?tag=d_2410643m_1599c_" href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Click here</a> to dive in!</strong><p class=align-left>The trick here is to make the market a 2-way bet and not a 3-way that will force bookmakers to refund bettors their money if the total number of goals is 2.</p><p class=align-left>It does not matter the time of the season or the teams playing.

That is because when one bet on over 2.5 goals, half of their stake goes to over 2 while the other half goes to over 2.5.</p><p class=align-left>If the match ends with 2 goals, they lose half of their stake placed on over 2.5 but get refunded the other half placed on over 2.
