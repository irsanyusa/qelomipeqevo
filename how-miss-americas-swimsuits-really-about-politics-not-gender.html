Nearly three in 10 men (29 percent) didn’t support the move.</p><p class=mb-s>The Miss America Organization “is allowing candidates to define their beauty through their accomplishments, their ability to command attention and defend their opinions,” a spokesperson told Morning Consult in an email this month. “We don’t feel young women of today should have to walk around in four inch heels and a bikini to exhibit their intelligence, talent and what they want to do with the job of Miss America in advancing their own personal social impact initiative.”</p><p class=mb-s>But not everyone is cheering these changes.</p><p class=mb-s>Four of the nine members of the Miss America Organization board quit or were forced to resign this summer, reportedly over the demise of the swimsuit portion of the competition.

And experts dismissed the idea that removing formal scoring for appearance meant Miss America contestants wouldn’t be judged on their looks.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiooqR7rrvRp6Cnn5Oku7TBy61lnKedZK6zwMico56rX528uHnMoqqsZZGisrO1wpqqZqunnrq0wcitqmaqlZa5rcWMmpmoraRivbC4yK2gnKtdo7y1ecaepZ2dog%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JazzVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
