Lincoln was unconscious and bleeding from the wound, and physicians found the bullet behind his left ear was lodged too deeply to be removed, though they were able to remove clots to improve his labored breathing.</p><p>His doctors decided that a carriage ride to the White House would be far too dangerous for the mortally wounded president, so he was taken to the house of a local tailor, William Peterson, and, due to his large height, was laid diagonally in a first-floor bedroom.</p><p>As he was attended throughout the night (he was shot at 10:15pm on April 14, 1865), his family members such as wife <a href=#>Mary Todd Lincoln</a> and son Robert Todd Lincoln were admitted to pay their final respects. Lincoln's colleagues, such as Secretary of War <a href=#>Edwin M. Stanton</a> and numerous others, were also allowed in to say their goodbyes.</p><p>Lincoln died at exactly 7:22 am the following day. His secretary <a href=#>John Hay</a> later wrote that "a look of unspeakable peace came upon his worn features" at the moment of his death. His Vice President, <a href=#>Andrew Johnson</a>, was sworn in after his death as the 17th President of the United States.</p><p>Lincoln was the first of four presidents to be assassinated: <a href=#>James Garfield</a> (1881), <a href=#>William McKinley</a> (1901) and <a href=#>John F. Kennedy</a> (1963) were the others.</p><span class=list-clearfix></span><h2>Photo Info</h2><p class="info-box info"><b>Photographer:</b> Julius Ulke<br><b>Date taken:</b> <a href=#>April 15, 1865</a><br><b>Location taken:</b> Washington D.C., USA<br><b>Source:</b> <a href=# rel=noopener>Wikimedia Commons</a></p><h2>Related Events</h2><p><h2>Related Articles and Photos</h2></p><ul class=article-list><li class=article-list__item><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.onthisday.com/images/articles/assassination-of-abraham-lincoln-sml.jpg alt="Final Deadly Performance of a Twisted Actor" width=270 height=225 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><h3>Final Deadly Performance of a Twisted Actor</h3><span class=linked_text>From a celebrated family of actors came a young man with a twisted mind whose last performance involved the death of a president.</span><br><span class=linked_date>February 20, 1817</span></a></li><li class=article-list__item><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.onthisday.com/images/photos/lincoln-grows-a-beard.jpg alt="Abraham Lincoln Grows a Beard" width=270 height=152 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><h3>Abraham Lincoln Grows a Beard</h3><span class=linked_text>Abraham Lincoln left, before he received the letter from Grace Bedell, and right, shortly before he met her in 1861</span><br><span class=linked_date>October 15, 1860</span></a></li><li class=article-list__item><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.onthisday.com/images/photos/assassination-of-president-lincoln.jpg alt="Assassination of Abraham Lincoln" width=270 height=190 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><h3>Assassination of Abraham Lincoln</h3><span class=linked_text>Lincoln is shot in the Ford's Theatre in Washington D.C. by John Wilkes Booth</span><br><span class=linked_date>April 14, 1865</span></a></li><li class=article-list__item><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.onthisday.com/images/photos/lincolns-assassins-are-executed.jpg alt="Execution of Lincoln's Assassins" width=270 height=212 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><h3>Execution of Lincoln's Assassins</h3><span class=linked_text>Mary Surratt, Lewis Powell, David Herold, and George Atzerodt are hanged for their part in the assassination of Abraham Lincoln</span><br><span class=linked_date>July 7, 1865</span></a></li><li class=article-list__item><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.onthisday.com/images/articles/john-surratt-sml.jpg alt="‘Dirty Rat’ Lets His Mother Die" width=270 height=225 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><h3>‘Dirty Rat’ Lets His Mother Die</h3><span class=linked_text>Before Abraham Lincoln was assassinated there was a plan to kidnap the President, which resulted on this day in the arrest of John Surratt, one of the plotters.</span><br><span class=linked_date>August 9, 1867</span></a></li></ul><h2>Related Famous People</h2><a href=# class=section__link><h2>Historical Photos</h2></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7sLrToaCsnJGue6S7zGinoaekpMBwrcGrmKGZnWK5qrrCqKOnq12ZsqLAx5ucnQ%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JazzVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
