Here is the ranking of every French player to play for the club.</p><h2>French players at Man United</h2><h3>13. William Prunier</h3><p class=align-left>Prunier played twice for the club in 1996 during an injury crisis. He left soon after.</p><h3>12. Gabriel Obertan</h3><p class=align-left>Obertan arrived as a replacement for Real Madrid-bound <a href=# rel=noopener>Cristiano Ronaldo</a>. He didn't live up to expectations and left after two seasons.</p><h3>11. David Bellion</h3><p class=align-left>Expectations were high for Bellion when he arrived at the club following Sunderland's relegation in 2003. He didn't impress and left the club in 2006.</p><h3>10. Morgan Schneiderlin</h3><p class=align-left>Schneiderlin arrived from Southampton during Louis Van Gaal's era but made just 32 Premier League appearances.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/560x315/733f098e03bc90b6.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=28><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Kanu, Aubameyang and other best Africans who played for Arsenal after black kit launch</span></p></a><h3>9. Laurent Blanc</h3><p class=align-left>Blanc arrived at Old Trafford as a 35-year-old <a href=#>World</a> Cup winner. Despite his age, he made an impact at the club.</p><h3>8. Raphael Varane</h3><p class=align-left>After years of unprecedented success at Real Madrid, Varane arrived at Old Trafford with a reputation to protect. He spent three seasons at the club and performed well when called upon, but injuries prevented affected him.</p><h3>7. Fabien Barthez</h3><p class=align-left>Barthez was seen as Peter Schmeichel's successor, but he wasn't. His time at the club was filled with glaring gaffes. He won two Premier League titles after three seasons at the club.</p><h3>6. Paul Pogba</h3><p class=align-left>The World Cup winner remains the most expensive player in club history, per <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Transfermarkt</a>, but he wasn't consistent enough. He spent six seasons at the club but didn't live up to the prize tag.</p><h3>5. Anthony Martial</h3><p class=align-left>The forward joined the club as a teenager in 2015. He impressed in his first few seasons at the club, but injuries derailed his career. He scored memorable goals and brought joy to fans during a difficult period.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/560x315/2e29f9f48046c12d.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Ballon d'Or: Four surprising candidates for the 2024 award</span></p></a><h3>4. Mikael Silvestre</h3><p class=align-left>The defender was a reliable option for Sir Alex Ferguson. He spent nearly a decade at Old Trafford, made over 350 appearances and won four league titles and the Champions League.</p><h3>3. Louis Saha</h3><p class=align-left>Saha was a success early at Man United. He played five seasons at the club and won two Premier League titles and the Champions League.</p><h3>2. Patrice Evra</h3><p class=align-left>The left-back won many trophies during one of the club's greatest eras under Sir Alex Ferguson. He was a vital part of the club's last five league titles and has not been fully replaced.</p><h3>1. Eric Cantona</h3><p class=align-left>The "King" joined Man United in 1992 from Leeds United. He registered 81 goals and 62 assists in 182 appearances and won a total of 11 trophies. He helped usher in the club's <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Premier League</a> dominance in the 1990s.</p><h3>Erik ten Hag blasted for pre-season defeat</h3><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/560x315/de6f226f541dda0e.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Euro 2024: Sunday Oliseh names 4 players key to Spain's title triumph</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Earlier, <strong>Legit.ng </strong>reported that <a href=#>Manchester United's 2024/25 season</a> began on a disappointing note with a defeat to Rosenborg in the Red Devils first pre-season game.</p><p class=align-left>Erik ten Hag’s side, featuring five first-team regulars from last season, lost by a last-minute goal by Noah Holm.</p><p class=align-left>Though it was only a friendly match, the result drew significant criticism from both Ten Hag and the fans, particularly since the Premier League team conceded more than 20 shots during the game.</p><p>Source: <a href=#>TUKO.co.ke</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rbHGoqtnppdkwLG70a2qaJ6fpMGjrculZmpuYGh%2Bd4WMq5ino5mjtG59kmadq52emLVuvMuasJ6qo2K%2FprzRnqqepqRiuqK6wqGcrKyVp3q2usitnJ1lnJq7r8WMsqarp6NiwKqzzaKloGc%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JazzVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
