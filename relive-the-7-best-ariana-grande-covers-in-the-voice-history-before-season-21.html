The newest The Voice coach shared <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">behind-the-scenes photos</a> working on the album with producer and former coach, <a href=#>Pharrell</a>. The pop diva’s connection to The Voice really was years in the making before she finally joined the show for <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Season 21</a>.</strong></p><p>Grande is currently preparing for the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Season 21 premiere</a> of The Voice on September 20. Viewers will absolutely be hearing more of her songs performed by artists during <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">the Blind Auditions</a>. Let’s take a look back at some of the best covers of her songs in the entire franchise so far.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-1-gean-garcia-and-ryleigh-modig-perform-pov>1. Gean Garcia and Ryleigh Modig Perform “pov”</h3><p>Gean Garcia and Ryleigh Modig performed Grande’s “pov” during The Battles in Season 20. This felt like more of a beautiful collaboration and less of an actual battle. Ryleigh’s vocals were so effortless. Gean nailed every single run in the song. Their voices meshed so well together, but Ryleigh really hypnotized viewers with her stunning vibrato. This is hands down one of the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">best performances on the show ever</a>.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" readability=2><p>https://youtu.be/d17vJ98jn-o</p></figure><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-2-hello-sunday-sings-almost-is-never-enough>2. Hello Sunday Sings “Almost is Never Enough”</h3><p>Duo Hello Sunday performed “Almost is Never Enough” during The Knockouts in Season 17. Their harmonies were absolutely transcendent on this song. The performance was chill-inducing and full of emotion. Props to their coach <a href=#>Kelly Clarkson</a> for still keeping the performance youthful and helping them choose the right song.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" readability=2><p>https://youtu.be/2ta__5mIEaI</p></figure><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-3-injoy-fountain-slays-7-rings>3. Injoy Fountain Slays “7 Rings”</h3><p>Injoy Fountain gets the award for the most energy during a Blind Audition on The Voice. Her cover of “7 Rings” was very fun and had Clarkson up on her feet singing along. Injoy made sure to add her own spin on the song and bring the most charisma possible to the stage.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" readability=2><p>https://youtu.be/d4E1erNt2UU</p></figure><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-4-sandyredd-performs-dangerous-woman>4. SandyRedd Performs “Dangerous Woman”</h3><p>Those of us who witnessed SandyRedd’s rendition of “Dangerous Woman” still cannot get it out of our heads. There was a reason why SandyRedd was the frontrunner the entire season. She commanded the stage and absolutely gave the performance her all.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-5-lady-shaynah-sings-nasa>5. Lady Shaynah Sings “NASA”</h3><p>Of course we have to mention some of the fantastic covers that contestants have performed in The Voice franchise globally. Lady Shaynah singing “NASA” on The Voice of Holland was a total vibe. She did the song justice by adding her own unique flare to the runs. The big note that she held toward the end made the crowd go wild.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" readability=2><p>https://youtu.be/ZbzHEQBTzXc</p></figure><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-6-mitch-paulsen-takes-on-thank-u-next>6. Mitch Paulsen Takes on “thank u, next”</h3><p>Mitch Paulsen sounded exactly like young Justin Bieber during his The Voice Australia audition. Singing “thank you, next,” a song about Grande’s past relationships, wasn’t the conventional choice. His acoustic version got a four-chair turn from the coaches. The tone of his voice is smooth like butter and had the entire audience on their feet.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-7-aydan-calafiore-sings-side-by-side>7. Aydan Calafiore Sings “Side By Side”</h3><p>During the Knockouts on <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Voice Australia</a> in 2018, Aydan Calafiore performed one of the funkiest Grande covers ever. He took on “Side to Side” the song featuring <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Nicki Minaj </a>that generated a ton of buzz online for its NSFW meaning. Aydan changed some of the lyrics and had everyone swaying in their seats.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><p>Catch Grande this season on The Voice when it premieres September 20.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Silky-Nutmeg-Ganache-RuPauls-Drag-Race-All-Stars-Eureka-OHara-Jan-Drag-Race-Twist.jpeg alt="‘Barbie Girl’ Lip-Sync Steals the Spotlight After a Queen Drops Out of ‘Drag Race’" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <span class=title-post-tagcloud>Tags</span> <a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>ariana grande</a><a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>The Voice</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK570Z6joq6VYsGpsYxwZJudo6l6or7ImqWaZZenrq%2BwxGaaqK6Vp8Butc1mq6GdXau8qq%2FEZp%2Biq6Skv7p5wZ6dqKqVYsCmrdKopWZqYWQ%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JazzVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
