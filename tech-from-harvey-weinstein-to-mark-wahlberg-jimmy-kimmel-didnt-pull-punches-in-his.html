But the late-night host pulled it off impressively and with his usual dry humor.</p><p>Looking back on the best-picture fiasco, Kimmel asked the nominees to not "get up right way" if they heard their name called. This was a reference to the close-to-two-minutes that "La La Land" was thought to be the winner of best picture last year before it was revealed that it was, in fact, "Moonlight."</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>But Kimmel's juicy material came when talked about Harvey Weinstein being kicked out of the Academy following the dozens of sexual misconduct allegations against him, and the wave of allegations against other powerful men in the industry after that.</p><p>Kimmel actually used a giant statue of the Oscar award on the stage next to him as a example of how men in Hollywood should act going forward.</p><p>"Oscar is the most respected man in Hollywood, he keeps his hands where you can see them, never says a rude word, and has no penis at all. That’s the kind of men we need," he said.</p><p>Kimmel also added, "Here’s how clueless Hollywood is about women: We made a movie called 'What Women Want' and it starred Mel Gibson."</p><p>Kimmel then addressed the pay gap controversy surrounding the movie “All the Money in the World,” in which it was reported Mark Wahlberg made much, much more than his costar Michelle Williams while doing reshoots of the movie after Kevin Spacey was replaced by Christopher Plummer (<a href=# id=b311c892-42fa-5190-9477-35e85a108b89>who is nominated for best supporting actor</a>).</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>“This one shook me because if we can’t trust agents, who can we trust,” Kimmel joked after pointing out that Wahlberg and Williams were represented by the same talent agency.</p><p>Kimmel also threw out some political jokes. The one that landed the best was talking about the Oscar-nominated movie, "Call Me by Your Name." Pointing out that it didn't make a lot of money at the box office, he said, "We don’t make movies like 'Call Me by Your Name' to make money, we make them to upset Mike Pence."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7scHLrJxnppdkr6p7056aoWekmrCpecWrpqZlmJa%2Ft7HYZq6eoZ6owaa1zWarqGWdlr%2Bsedaan6Walae0brbIpqSyZZueuq6xy2abopyeqXqxwculZKmtnpi1pr%2BMoqVmoJmofHl%2FkGlscKw%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JazzVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
