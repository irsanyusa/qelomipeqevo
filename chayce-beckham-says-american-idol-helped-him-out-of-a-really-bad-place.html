Beckham told <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Audacy’s 103.7 KSON</a> about his time competing on Idol in 2021.</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-chayce-beckham-talks-about-his-american-idol-journey>Chayce Beckham Talks About His American Idol Journey</h2><p>Beckham told hosts John & Tammy that his experience competing on American Idol was a positive one. Although he admitted that some contestants had “artist complexes” (or LSD, “Lead Singer Disease,” as he called it), he was able to connect with a lot of them on a deeper level.</p><p>“For me, I was in a very bad part of my life, and I was able to kind of bring myself out of a really bad place by going on that show,” said Beckham, who has been open about his past substance abuse. “At a time where I felt really alone, I got to connect with a lot of other incredible musicians who I still call my friends today. It was a great experience.”</p><p>Since his time on the show, Beckham has toured multiple times with judge Luke Bryan, including over 40 shows last year. He called Bryan “one of the good ones” and praised the judges for “the amount that they care about the artists who are on the show.”</p><p class=has-text-align-left><strong>SEE ALSO: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">HOW NOAH THOMPSON, CHAYCE BECKHAM CONVINCED HUNTERGIRL TO RELEASE ‘AIN’T ABOUT YOU’</a></strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-beckham-reflects-on-success-of-song-23>Beckham Reflects on Success of Song ’23’</h2><p>Beckham released his original song “23” in 2021 as part of his time on American Idol. However, the song has recently started garnering more attention on country radio. The track will appear on Beckham’s upcoming album Bad For Me, out April 5.</p><p>“You just can’t rush it,” Beckham said. “I’ve been grinding this song for three years, and we’re finally at a point where it’s cracking the top five of radio, and we’re seeing a lot of streams. It’s just a long journey, and there’s a lot of points where you feel like giving up, but you just keep it going.”</p><p>Beckham admitted that it’s strange to call the song new, since he first shared it almost three years ago. However, he appreciates that the track has reached “a whole new audience,” including people who don’t even realize he was on American Idol.</p><p>Beckham recently released another song from Bad For Me, titled “Waylon in ’75.” You can stream it now.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Original_AbiCarter_Julia_Gagnon_OdellButonJR_Disney_Eric-McCandless-220x147.jpg alt="‘American Idol’ Platinum Ticket Recipients Sing Together in Early Release Clip" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <span class=title-post-tagcloud>Tags</span> <a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>American Idol</a><a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>Chayce Beckham</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57wqGYspuVYq%2Bmr8qhmKZlo5bGtHnAppyroZOWu261w6ijZqCVob2msIyhoKZln6rBbrvFZphmqpWWua3FjJuYnWWgoa6ksY4%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JazzVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
