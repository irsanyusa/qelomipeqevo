This kind of&nbsp;move from MILs can really stir the pot, especially during the crazy times of&nbsp;planning a&nbsp;wedding. Her MIL choosing a&nbsp;white dress, which is&nbsp;usually just for the bride, really kicked off some arguments and piled on&nbsp;stress to&nbsp;an&nbsp;already hectic day. Her story shines a&nbsp;light on&nbsp;the tricky task of&nbsp;dealing with <a href=# title=family data-link=tag>family</a> stuff while trying to&nbsp;plan your big day, something a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;people can relate&nbsp;to.</p><p><h2>The woman turned to&nbsp;Reddit to&nbsp;seek advices.</h2></p><p>“I’m getting married soon, and we’re having a&nbsp;traditional wedding (I’m Indian, my&nbsp;fiancé isn’t, but he&nbsp;was fine with having an&nbsp;Indian wedding). My&nbsp;MIL-to-be asked me&nbsp;if&nbsp;she could wear white to&nbsp;our wedding, I&nbsp;said sure, and now my&nbsp;fiancé is&nbsp;really mad at&nbsp;me. He&nbsp;says she is&nbsp;going to&nbsp;try to&nbsp;steal the spotlight, and she’ll definitely show up&nbsp;wearing a&nbsp;long white dress, and it&nbsp;was very irresponsible of&nbsp;me&nbsp;to&nbsp;just agree like that.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/ebc/f51/44249c5bb4b58ad916e1190ad4.jpg><p>“The thing is&nbsp;I’m not going to&nbsp;be&nbsp;wearing a&nbsp;white bridal dress, I’ll be&nbsp;wearing a&nbsp;traditional red dress that due to&nbsp;the design (lehenga), type of&nbsp;silk and embroidery is&nbsp;very distinctive so&nbsp;even if&nbsp;my&nbsp;MIL <i>does</i> wear a&nbsp;white wedding dress it’s not like it’ll be&nbsp;the same? Also, this may be&nbsp;dumb, but&nbsp;I don’t really get what the big deal is&nbsp;if&nbsp;my&nbsp;MIL wears white even if&nbsp;I was also going&nbsp;to? As&nbsp;long as&nbsp;the groom doesn’t get confused and marry the wrong person, how does it&nbsp;matter?</p><p>Sorry if&nbsp;this is&nbsp;dumb, but my&nbsp;fiancé is&nbsp;really upset that&nbsp;I didn’t stop my&nbsp;MIL, and&nbsp;I just need some help to&nbsp;understand, I&nbsp;didn’t mean to&nbsp;upset him. I&nbsp;talked to&nbsp;my&nbsp;fiancé about why he&nbsp;was concerned. He&nbsp;explained that his mother had previously ‘joked’ that she would wear white, and he&nbsp;had told her point-blank that she wasn’t allowed to&nbsp;do&nbsp;this. (He&nbsp;didn’t tell me&nbsp;about this because he&nbsp;didn’t want to&nbsp;stress me&nbsp;out, apparently she has a&nbsp;tendency to&nbsp;steal attention throughout his childhood, which left some trauma.) So&nbsp;basically when&nbsp;I told MIL she could wear white, he&nbsp;was very upset that&nbsp;I had given permission when he&nbsp;had categorically refused, but he&nbsp;admitted it&nbsp;was wrong of&nbsp;him to&nbsp;get that upset when he&nbsp;hadn’t shared any of&nbsp;the background information with&nbsp;me.”</p><p>“We&nbsp;agreed that going forward we&nbsp;would be&nbsp;better about <a href=# title=communicating data-link=tag>communicating</a>, and made&nbsp;up, but then he&nbsp;wanted me&nbsp;to&nbsp;call up&nbsp;MIL and tell her she couldn’t wear white or&nbsp;else she was banned from the wedding. Which, I&nbsp;didn’t really want to&nbsp;do&nbsp;because that sounded like a&nbsp;surefire recipe for open hostility, and like&nbsp;I said earlier, I&nbsp;don’t actually have a&nbsp;problem with MIL wearing white. I&nbsp;told him that <i>he</i>&nbsp;was welcome to&nbsp;tell her if&nbsp;he&nbsp;wanted, but he&nbsp;was insisting&nbsp;I have to&nbsp;tell her because&nbsp;I was the one who gave permission.”</p><p><h2>People offered her various perspectives.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/2a6/3d1/1c5d59581e8dd2d824288a9dcc.jpg><ul><li>Please have a&nbsp;conversation with your partner.

I&nbsp;know it&nbsp;doesn’t matter to&nbsp;you since you’re having an&nbsp;Indian wedding ceremony. I&nbsp;think why your fiancé is&nbsp;mad is&nbsp;because&nbsp;I assume his family and other non-Indian people will be&nbsp;at&nbsp;the wedding, and it&nbsp;sounds like she wants to&nbsp;show off for them. It’s his mom, so&nbsp;I’d tell fiancé if&nbsp;he’s mad, then he&nbsp;needs to&nbsp;speak to&nbsp;his mother about&nbsp;it. <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>disney_nerd_mom&nbsp;/ Reddit</i></a></li><li>Your fiancé is&nbsp;probably upset because it’s the ultimate in&nbsp;cliché monster-in-law moves. Unless she’s just naive, mothers tend to&nbsp;do&nbsp;this because they want to&nbsp;be&nbsp;the center of&nbsp;attention. She may have something against you, or&nbsp;maybe she just can’t handle not being the star of&nbsp;the show. There’s also an&nbsp;ick factor because wearing white at&nbsp;a&nbsp;wedding kind of&nbsp;makes it&nbsp;look like she’s trying to&nbsp;marry her own son.<br>It&nbsp;sounds like your fiancé is&nbsp;trying to&nbsp;make sure you’re the star of&nbsp;the wedding. He&nbsp;might also be&nbsp;expecting some more bad behavior on&nbsp;her part and thinks the dress is&nbsp;just the first step. Sit down with him and ask him to&nbsp;explain why he&nbsp;is&nbsp;specifically upset about this. Let him know you aren’t concerned since your lehenga is&nbsp;red, not white, so&nbsp;her attempt to&nbsp;steal attention is&nbsp;pretty weak. He&nbsp;might still be&nbsp;upset because of&nbsp;his mother’s behavior. I’d suggest letting him address it&nbsp;with her. <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>GloomyMarzipan&nbsp;/ Reddit</i></a></li></ul><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/edf/1a1/a9d59753548610f987a6977d3f.jpg><ul><li>I&nbsp;know many people have said the “only the bride wears white” tradition is&nbsp;about attention, but it’s also about <a href=# title=respect data-link=tag>respect</a>. Even if&nbsp;you don’t care because you’ll be&nbsp;following Indian customs, your future MIL will be&nbsp;making a&nbsp;very loud statement that she doesn’t respect your marriage, and she expects to&nbsp;always be&nbsp;the most important woman in&nbsp;your husband’s life. Similarly, in&nbsp;some areas it’s taboo for the mother of&nbsp;the groom to&nbsp;wear black because it&nbsp;says she’s mourning her son’s choice of&nbsp;bride. Literally, a&nbsp;fashion statement. <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>scranston&nbsp;/ Reddit</i></a></li><li>If&nbsp;your tradition doesn’t conform to&nbsp;the western norms of&nbsp;a&nbsp;white wedding dress, then you’d be&nbsp;correct in&nbsp;not dictating that she can’t wear white. Is&nbsp;your fiancé from your culture, or&nbsp;is&nbsp;he&nbsp;Western? She may try to&nbsp;upstage you in&nbsp;other ways, but she’ll be&nbsp;the one out of&nbsp;place wearing a&nbsp;white wedding dress to&nbsp;an&nbsp;Indian wedding. <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Few-Entrepreneur383&nbsp;/ Reddit</i></a></li><li>In&nbsp;western culture, anyone wearing white to&nbsp;a&nbsp;wedding (aside from the bride) is&nbsp;considered an&nbsp;insult, except for when the bride and groom request. It’s mostly considered a&nbsp;dig at&nbsp;the bride, and it’s even more so&nbsp;when it’s a&nbsp;member of&nbsp;the groom’s family. The fact that the future MIL asked you beforehand would say to&nbsp;me&nbsp;that she was being deliberately disingenuous with you. Because, by&nbsp;wearing white, she can now freely insult you and your wedding to&nbsp;the other guests while you are not only unaware of&nbsp;the insult, but unknowingly allowing&nbsp;it.<br>You didn’t think to&nbsp;ask your fiancé because it’s not a&nbsp;part of&nbsp;your culture. You did nothing wrong by&nbsp;being kind to&nbsp;your future MIL. <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>ITouchMyself2Much&nbsp;/ Reddit</i></a></li></ul><p>Wedding planning can get pretty tense, like with this bride, who ended up&nbsp;booting out one of&nbsp;her <a href=#>bridesmaids</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZLq6ecyio2avkaPBtHnTqGSwnZGneqJ51qGgrZ1dnLy4uoyaq2alqWLEprDDoqWgZWhmhHODj2g%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JazzVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
