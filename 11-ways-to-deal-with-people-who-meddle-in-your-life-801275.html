His name is&nbsp;Marplot, a&nbsp;pun on&nbsp;him marring people’s plots. It&nbsp;seems like nothing much has changed today, as&nbsp;we&nbsp;all have to&nbsp;face people who like to&nbsp;get involved in&nbsp;our lives at&nbsp;one point or&nbsp;the other. But we&nbsp;can take charge so&nbsp;that these people won’t interfere with our lives any longer.</p><p>We&nbsp;at&nbsp;<strong>Bright Side</strong> break down the different methods we&nbsp;can take to&nbsp;deal with people who stick their noses into our business.</p><p><h2>1. Try to&nbsp;see if&nbsp;they mean well.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/844/c63/b1ffac59778a253d0fd6cdf5cb.jpg><p>Sometimes people have good <a href=#>intentions</a> but the way they say things sounds hurtful. Try to&nbsp;take a&nbsp;step back and assess whether they actually have your best interests at&nbsp;heart. There could be&nbsp;some truth in&nbsp;what they’re saying. But it&nbsp;could also be&nbsp;because they care about themselves, and you do&nbsp;not fit into their idea of&nbsp;something, which means it&nbsp;really isn’t because of&nbsp;your shortcomings.</p><p><h2>2. Draw clear boundaries.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/eff/a32/f7830b598bbb93e64ac8343654.jpg><p>Use <a href=#>assertive</a> “I” statements to&nbsp;say that you won’t be&nbsp;entertaining the topic, e.g., “I&nbsp;don’t discuss my&nbsp;salary.” Learn to&nbsp;say no&nbsp;and know that you don’t even have to&nbsp;give them an&nbsp;explanation for&nbsp;it, e.g., “No, don’t set me&nbsp;up&nbsp;with anyone.” It&nbsp;is&nbsp;also helpful to&nbsp;safeguard your things, like not leaving your phone lying around or&nbsp;your Facebook account logged in&nbsp;on&nbsp;a&nbsp;shared computer, so&nbsp;that the meddlers can’t get access to&nbsp;your information.</p><p><h2>3. Don’t take it&nbsp;personally.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/bab/90a/be815e594480f9ceb42b79729e.jpg><p>Know that you can control what you&nbsp;do, but you can’t control what others&nbsp;do. So&nbsp;even if&nbsp;you know that they shouldn’t have said or&nbsp;asked what they did, you can control how you feel about&nbsp;it. Try to&nbsp;<a href=#>focus</a> on&nbsp;what they’re saying, rather than whether or&nbsp;not it&nbsp;should have happened.</p><p><h2>4. Ignore them.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/322/9ef/ae72595d0183821a033479e76f.jpg><p>There are some people that you cannot avoid and have to&nbsp;maintain a&nbsp;civil relationship with, like your colleague or&nbsp;your neighbor. If&nbsp;they meddle in&nbsp;your life, as&nbsp;long as&nbsp;it&nbsp;does not get out of&nbsp;hand, perhaps it&nbsp;is&nbsp;<a href=#>best</a> to&nbsp;pay no&nbsp;attention to&nbsp;them.</p><p><h2>5. Don’t share private things with them.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/793/45d/20e40c5f5295552bce2eabc97e.jpg><p>Your personal information fuels nosy people, because once they know something about you they’ll want to&nbsp;comment on&nbsp;it&nbsp;or&nbsp;question&nbsp;it. So&nbsp;try to&nbsp;keep things to&nbsp;yourself, even if&nbsp;they ask you about it&nbsp;by&nbsp;giving a&nbsp;<a href=#>non-answer</a>. Let’s say someone asked, “Why are you still single?” you could answer with “How sweet of&nbsp;you to&nbsp;be&nbsp;concerned.” You could also ensure that they can’t easily get your information by&nbsp;restricting their access on&nbsp;social media.</p><p><h2>6. Retort with polite comebacks.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/5c4/04f/b189c25077b206d535d75e547e.jpg><p>While you shouldn’t be&nbsp;rude, it&nbsp;doesn’t mean that you can’t come up&nbsp;with a&nbsp;sassy comeback. You could also turn the table around and <a href=#>say</a>, “I&nbsp;didn’t realize you were so&nbsp;invested in&nbsp;my&nbsp;situation. Is&nbsp;there a&nbsp;reason for that?” This may catch them off guard because now they’re the one who is&nbsp;faced with a&nbsp;difficult question.</p><p><h2>7. React with kindness.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/e2d/dd1/847f005b009ab20ade40d98c3c.jpg><p>In&nbsp;some cases, people intrude in&nbsp;other people’s lives because they’re unhappy with their own. It’s possible that being involved in&nbsp;your life helps them to&nbsp;feel better about their own. So&nbsp;it&nbsp;might be&nbsp;helpful to&nbsp;lend them an&nbsp;<a href=#>empathetic ear</a>. If&nbsp;they say “Why did you divorce such a&nbsp;nice guy?” you could shrug and reply politely with “Did you have an&nbsp;experience with divorce that you regret?”</p><p><h2>8. Minimize your time with them.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/100/0dd/2934c254f4bd1bc76a5b50fef9.jpg><p>The simplest way to&nbsp;deal with a&nbsp;busybody is&nbsp;to&nbsp;<a href=#>reduce your interaction</a> with them. If&nbsp;you can get away from engaging with them, do&nbsp;so. For example, you could easily screen their name so&nbsp;that every time they call, you don’t have to&nbsp;answer. Otherwise, just make sure that you spend as&nbsp;little time with them as&nbsp;possible.</p><p><h2>9. Deflect to&nbsp;change the topic.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/fd2/e87/7571f45a999c5e64f871ccffc5.jpg><p>Lying could get you in&nbsp;trouble later, so&nbsp;one of&nbsp;the best ways to&nbsp;avoid answering nosy questions is&nbsp;by&nbsp;<a href=#>changing the subject</a>. If&nbsp;someone asks you something you’re not comfortable answering, you can also shift the focus so&nbsp;that they’re the one who needs to&nbsp;answer a&nbsp;question. For example, if&nbsp;someone asks, “You still don’t have a&nbsp;child?” you can say “I&nbsp;remember you have 3&nbsp;kids. How old are they now?”</p><p><h2>10. Tell them how you feel.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/ace/4a2/24c85f5b63b2f4700de63784b7.jpg><p>Confronting people and <a href=#>opening your heart</a> to&nbsp;them might make you seem vulnerable, but it&nbsp;might do&nbsp;both of&nbsp;you a&nbsp;favor. Some people may think they’re only saying harmless things without knowing their words cause you pain. But if&nbsp;they turn defensive or&nbsp;belittle you more after you tell them about your discomfort, it’s a&nbsp;clear sign that they’re the kind of&nbsp;people you should stay away from.</p><p><h2>11. Brush it&nbsp;off with humor.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/db0/a51/dc93ca51d9b2a6d4e1ff7f22dc.jpg><p>If&nbsp;you prefer for things to&nbsp;stay comfortable and for everybody to&nbsp;save face, use <a href=#>humor</a>. The meddler may not get the hint or&nbsp;ignore it&nbsp;completely, but at&nbsp;least you can laugh about&nbsp;it. When asked, “Are you seeing anyone?” you can reply with “I’m seeing that pie over there and it&nbsp;looks delicious.”</p><p>What kind of&nbsp;comments or&nbsp;questions have you gotten from people who try to&nbsp;get involved in&nbsp;your life?
