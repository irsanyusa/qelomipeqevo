People who have seen these competitions are often amazed by&nbsp;the movements of&nbsp;the athletes jumping in&nbsp;and out of&nbsp;the water and their colorful swimsuits. But for all this to&nbsp;happen, athletes must do&nbsp;a&nbsp;lot behind the scenes, which truly makes this sport shine with its light.</p><p><h2>1. Artistic swimming athletes perform their routine in&nbsp;front of&nbsp;15&nbsp;judges.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/051/a30/25e83c5a3689cc289896fe2131.jpg><p>ALBERTO PIZZOLI/AFP/East News</p><p>In&nbsp;a&nbsp;competition of&nbsp;this <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>discipline</a>, you’ll find a&nbsp;jury composed of&nbsp;three panels, each with five judges. Each of&nbsp;these panels evaluates a&nbsp;different aspect of&nbsp;the routine. During practice, the first panel rates the execution, another the impression, and the third the elements used. On&nbsp;the other hand, in&nbsp;the free routines, one panel evaluates the performance, another the artistic image, and the third the difficulty.</p><p><h2>2. They usually design and apply their own make-up.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/80f/996/754d00526f80fb711d9ef9e27f.jpg><p>Some of&nbsp;the teams in&nbsp;this sport have little money, so&nbsp;they cannot afford to&nbsp;hire a&nbsp;professional makeup artist for every competition. Therefore, the swimmers <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>opt</a> to&nbsp;create their makeup designs and apply them themselves.</p><p><h2>3. Swimmers spend a&nbsp;lot on&nbsp;makeup.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/551/13a/16efbe5fa380e68fa77a1502b4.jpg><p>Preparing for a&nbsp;competition is&nbsp;not <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>cheap</a>. Each swimmer uses, on&nbsp;average, one bottle of&nbsp;sunscreen per week and one new swimsuit per month. However, when it&nbsp;comes to&nbsp;makeup, it’s not out of&nbsp;vanity that these athletes wear about ten lipsticks throughout their careers. Like the makeup used on&nbsp;TV sets, it&nbsp;may look extreme up&nbsp;close, but it&nbsp;seems almost natural from a&nbsp;distance.</p><p><h2>4. They must meet established time frames.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/e94/b2d/8ade295a5085d4f6a93c013480.jpg><p>According to&nbsp;the <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>basic principles</a> of&nbsp;artistic swimming, each routine can last from two and a&nbsp;half to&nbsp;five minutes. This will depend on&nbsp;the number of&nbsp;people on&nbsp;the team competing. However, no&nbsp;matter how many athletes are in&nbsp;the water, they will be&nbsp;penalized if&nbsp;their routine lasts 15&nbsp;seconds more or&nbsp;less than what it&nbsp;should.</p><p><h2>5. It&nbsp;improves the cardiovascular system.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/e02/583/2f54e0544db30e849837e16a9b.jpg><p>Swimming, in&nbsp;general, is&nbsp;a&nbsp;sport known for <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>improving</a> the cardiovascular system of&nbsp;those who practice&nbsp;it, since it&nbsp;increases the use of&nbsp;oxygen in&nbsp;the body without causing excessive work to&nbsp;the heart. This leads to&nbsp;a&nbsp;40% reduction in&nbsp;the risk of&nbsp;suffering from a&nbsp;myocardial disease.</p><p><h2>6. Sometimes, they have to&nbsp;pass a&nbsp;flexibility test.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/002/5ef/74fc7d51d78a0287452cc1ebf2.jpg><p>Athletes may be&nbsp;required to&nbsp;pass a&nbsp;flexibility <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>test</a> before presenting their rehearsed routine in&nbsp;major competitions. Judges will add one point to&nbsp;the team’s final result for each team member who passes the test.</p><p><h2>7. They must choose the right swimsuit.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/45b/081/81bc5b5b4388c21cd32cfba4bd.jpg><p>CHINE NOUVELLE/SIPA/SIPA/East News<span>, </span>FRANCOIS-XAVIER MARIT/AFP/East News</p><p>Artistic swimmers must be&nbsp;cautious with the swimsuits they choose for this sport: not only must they take into account the material it&nbsp;is&nbsp;made&nbsp;of, but also the <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>design</a>. Ideally, it&nbsp;should be&nbsp;a&nbsp;comfortable, light, and supportive swimsuit. Designs having an&nbsp;“X” in&nbsp;the back and high-cut legs are the most common because they allow greater freedom of&nbsp;movement.</p><p><h2>8. Some competitions require specific skills.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/096/ac9/0af4b25b4e8be4a395ac5c61e3.jpg><p>Artistic swimming competitions can be&nbsp;very demanding, not only in&nbsp;terms of&nbsp;time or&nbsp;make-up, but also with the clothes they wear. In&nbsp;compulsory figure competitions, the winners must perform specific figures in&nbsp;front of&nbsp;a&nbsp;jury, which is&nbsp;in&nbsp;charge of&nbsp;evaluating the technique with which they do&nbsp;it. Therefore, to&nbsp;avoid distractions or&nbsp;for someone to&nbsp;stand out, wearing a&nbsp;black bathing suit without visible logos and a&nbsp;white bathing cap is&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>mandatory</a>.</p><p><h2>9. They actually don’t know how long they can hold their breath.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/f51/72b/2b6359527eae78fd7693f1a830.jpg><p>Many of&nbsp;us might think these athletes can hold their breath underwater for a&nbsp;long time. However, even they do&nbsp;not know that to&nbsp;be&nbsp;true. This is&nbsp;because, while <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>training</a> or&nbsp;competing, they do&nbsp;not hold their breath while standing still, as&nbsp;they enter and exit the water every few seconds.</p><p><h2>10. Some athletes do&nbsp;not wear nose clips.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/a8e/e65/5d93ea5f21a59d71b51a378e00.jpg><p>AP/East News</p><p>These accessories are used to&nbsp;prevent water from entering the nostrils of&nbsp;swimmers. And, despite being a&nbsp;bit uncomfortable, most athletes wear them. However, others have devised different ways to&nbsp;keep water out of&nbsp;their noses. For example, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Mary Killman</a> can cover her nostrils with her upper lip.</p><p><h2>11. They swim with their eyes open.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/5a9/79b/6640f75cd3baa21fce0ad0fd56.jpg><p>OLI SCARFF/AFP/East News</p><p>Although they are not allowed to&nbsp;wear goggles, they must keep their eyes <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>open</a> at&nbsp;all times, even when they are underwater. During a&nbsp;routine, they mustn’t lose sight of&nbsp;their partners so&nbsp;that, if&nbsp;necessary, they can correct their alignment or&nbsp;prepare specific movements.</p><p><h2>12. They are not ashamed of&nbsp;their period.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/00e/1e1/a97b31545b95e26c59a08dc679.jpg><p>During an&nbsp;interview, Olympic gold medalist Kelsi Worrell <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>said</a>, “Nothing is&nbsp;too embarrassing. We&nbsp;are so&nbsp;vulnerable with each other and so&nbsp;open that we&nbsp;are there to&nbsp;help each other.” For example, if&nbsp;someone has a&nbsp;tampon string in&nbsp;plain sight, the other teammates help by&nbsp;pointing it&nbsp;out.</p><p>What sports have you played, and what were their specificities?
