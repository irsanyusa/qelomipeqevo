You’re not the only one who spends hours scrolling through the internet in&nbsp;search of&nbsp;that “magic” product that will instantly make you look and feel beautiful. Recently, <a href=# title=TikTok data-link=tag>TikTok</a> users have been raving about a&nbsp;newly-found <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>carbonated bubble clay mask</a>, and it&nbsp;seems like everyone has something positive to&nbsp;say about&nbsp;it. This made&nbsp;us curious, so&nbsp;we&nbsp;decided to&nbsp;check it&nbsp;out for ourselves.</p><p>We&nbsp;have also prepared a&nbsp;bonus section where you can find other internet-famous products that will help you achieve flawless, glowing skin.

Charcoal powder, its natural active ingredient, acts as&nbsp;an&nbsp;effective detoxifier, while the bubble effect gives you a&nbsp;nice tingling sensation and ensures a&nbsp;deep cleansing of&nbsp;the pores. Your skin will have a&nbsp;smooth, radiant appearance thanks to&nbsp;the extra dose of&nbsp;<a href=# title=collagen data-link=tag>collagen</a> that this mask contains.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/8e9/c9f/a5113b5123bc57d734e9d55072.jpg><p>To&nbsp;make the best use of&nbsp;it, just follow these simple steps:</p><ul><li>Apply the mask evenly on&nbsp;your dry face with a&nbsp;spatula applicator, a&nbsp;sponge, or&nbsp;simply use your fingers. You don’t need to&nbsp;remove make-up beforehand.</li><li>Wait 5&nbsp;minutes until the bubbles appear.</li><li>Leave it&nbsp;on&nbsp;for another 10&nbsp;minutes while mud and charcoal ingredients are actively working on&nbsp;cleansing your skin.</li><li>Gently rub in&nbsp;the remaining mask and use lukewarm water to&nbsp;remove the excess.</li><li>Use it&nbsp;3-4 times a&nbsp;week.</li></ul><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/923/0c8/df09c75db6a0e70698225b3221.jpg><p>So, why do&nbsp;we&nbsp;like it&nbsp;so&nbsp;much?<br></p><ul><li>It’s based on&nbsp;natural ingredients that are suitable for a&nbsp;wide range of&nbsp;skin types and all ages, as&nbsp;well as&nbsp;both men and women.</li><li>The price is&nbsp;great! Good-quality skincare products often come with a&nbsp;hefty price tag, but that is&nbsp;not the case with this popular bubbly face mask. You get all the goodness of&nbsp;the premium ingredients while staying on&nbsp;a&nbsp;budget.</li><li>Judging by&nbsp;thousands of&nbsp;positive reviews, this charcoal mask obviously gives good results in&nbsp;a&nbsp;short time.</li><li>It’s super fun to&nbsp;use, which makes it&nbsp;a&nbsp;perfect gift and an&nbsp;essential item for an&nbsp;unforgettable spa day at&nbsp;home with friends.</li></ul><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/5e5/04f/e776e451f087f26ab5abee5f86.jpg><p><strong>Just look at&nbsp;all those rave reviews:</strong></p><ul><li><i><strong>Amazing</strong>. Skin feels brilliant after and is&nbsp;easy to&nbsp;apply with the brush that comes with&nbsp;it. One of&nbsp;the best masks I’ve used, and the quantity lasts long as&nbsp;you do&nbsp;not need to&nbsp;use much.</i><br><a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Leona Welsh&nbsp;/ Amazon</i></a></li></ul><ul><li><i><strong>This mask really works! And it’s fun!</strong></i><strong> </strong><i>Okay, honestly&nbsp;I purchased 3&nbsp;of&nbsp;these not really caring if&nbsp;it&nbsp;was an&nbsp;amazing product or&nbsp;not but because it&nbsp;seemed really fun. You only need to&nbsp;put a&nbsp;thin layer all over your face (and neck if&nbsp;you want) and within seconds the mask will begin to&nbsp;bubble. It&nbsp;feels really cool and after about 10-15 mins (this was my&nbsp;experience) it&nbsp;stopped bubbling, and&nbsp;I looked in&nbsp;the mirror and about died laughing. It&nbsp;got soooo puffy! Tip: make sure you don’t put it&nbsp;too close to&nbsp;your eyebrows, or&nbsp;you’ll end up&nbsp;with little bubbly poofs on&nbsp;your eyelashes, and you don’t want to&nbsp;get this in&nbsp;your eyes.</i><br><i>After it&nbsp;was done bubbling and&nbsp;I died a&nbsp;death from laughing, I&nbsp;gently wiped the excessive bubbles off my&nbsp;face and then added water and massaged my&nbsp;face as&nbsp;the instructions said. To&nbsp;my&nbsp;surprise, the mask started bubbling even more as&nbsp;I was massaging my&nbsp;face with water and rinsing it&nbsp;off. It&nbsp;took a&nbsp;little while to&nbsp;rinse this mask completely off, but&nbsp;I could literally FEEL my&nbsp;pores being cleaned out, and it&nbsp;left my&nbsp;face so&nbsp;soft and so&nbsp;clean.</i><br><i>I&nbsp;was genuinely impressed with how well this product actually cleaned my&nbsp;skin and pores, since&nbsp;I mostly bought it&nbsp;because it&nbsp;seemed fun. All in&nbsp;all, it&nbsp;ended up&nbsp;not only being fun and making me&nbsp;laugh, but it&nbsp;also WORKED, and it&nbsp;worked really well!</i><br><a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Allie Bee&nbsp;/ Amazon</i></a></li></ul><ul><li><i><strong>Might be&nbsp;a&nbsp;Holy Grail for&nbsp;me.</strong></i><strong> </strong><i>I&nbsp;have had a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;face masks and mostly have felt like they felt nice while&nbsp;on, but didn’t do&nbsp;much for my&nbsp;skin. This one is&nbsp;amazing. My&nbsp;skin has felt congested and oily since summer started. I&nbsp;have a&nbsp;few products&nbsp;I use that can help&nbsp;— but THIS ONE&nbsp;— perfect. I&nbsp;didn’t think my&nbsp;pores were a&nbsp;problem and never was able to&nbsp;extract any actual whiteheads etc., until&nbsp;I used this mask&nbsp;— had no&nbsp;idea there was stuff that needed to&nbsp;come out until&nbsp;I washed off the bubbles. I&nbsp;have to&nbsp;figure out how many times per week to&nbsp;use this, and definitely need a&nbsp;moisturizer after&nbsp;— but I&nbsp;am already seeing a&nbsp;difference in&nbsp;my&nbsp;bumps and small acne!</i><br><a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Keri Starrs&nbsp;/ Amazon</i></a></li></ul><p>Buy the carbonated bubble clay mask <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><strong>HERE</strong></a></p><p><h2>BONUS: If&nbsp;that didn’t satisfy your skincare obsession, we&nbsp;recommend you try the following products as&nbsp;well.</h2></p><h2>1.
