While the show has had many incredible guest judges over the years, there are still many celebrities who we would love to see on the judging panel. We have compiled a dream guest judge list of celebrities that we believe would bring their unique perspectives and energy to the show.</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Celebrities We’d Love to See As a Guest Judge on RuPaul’s Drag Race</h2><h3 class=wp-block-heading>1. Billy Porter</h3><p>A celebrity who would make a great addition to the judging panel is Billy Porter. Porter has become a trailblazer for gender fluidity and has used his platform to advocate for LGBTQ+ rights. His experience as a Broadway performer and fashion icon would make him an ideal candidate for a guest judge spot on the show.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>2. Trixie Mattel</h3><p>We would also love to see drag queen and recording artist <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Trixie Mattel</a> as a guest judge on the show. Mattel has already made appearances on the show as a contestant and as a host of its spin-off series. Her wit, humor, and musical talent would make her a great addition to the judging panel.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>3. Tiffany Haddish</h3><p>Tiffany Haddish would be an excellent choice for a guest judge. Haddish has made a name for herself as one of the funniest and most relatable comedians working today. Her quick wit and infectious personality would bring a new level of humor and entertainment to the show.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>4. Laverne Cox</h3><p>As an actress and advocate for transgender rights, Laverne Cox would be a perfect fit for a guest judge spot. She has been vocal about her love of the show. She has even appeared as a guest host on its spin-off series. Her experience in the entertainment industry and passion for LGBTQ+ activism would make her a valuable addition to the judging panel.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>5. Dolly Parton</h3><p>With her iconic style and personality, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Dolly Parton</a> would be a dream guest judge for RuPaul’s Drag Race. She has been a vocal ally for the LGBTQ+ community and has worked with numerous drag performers over the years. Her experience as a country music legend and her larger-than-life persona would add a new level of fun and excitement to the show. There actually was an entire runway themed after the artist in Drag Race All Stars 7.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>6. Cardi B</h3><p>With her bold fashion choices and larger-than-life personality, Cardi B would be an excellent addition to the judging panel on RuPaul’s Drag Race. She has been an advocate for LGBTQ+ rights and has even performed in drag herself. Her experience as a musician and performer would make her a valuable guest judge, and her outspoken nature would add an extra level of entertainment to the show.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>7. Bruno Tonioli</h3><p>Dancing With the Stars and Britain’s Got Talent judge <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Bruno Tonioli</a> would be an amazing addition to the Drag Race judging panel. He would be perfect to judge dance, since he’s a professionally trained choreographer. As loved on DWTS and BGT, Tonioli would not be able to sit still on this panel.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>8. Cher</h3><p>Fans are eagerly awaiting the day when Cher accepts the invite to be a guest judge. Ironically, Cher’s mother, Georgia Holt, and son, Chaz Bono, have already been on the show’s judging panel. In a publicly released statement, Cher has revealed that she’d join the show eventually, but it hasn’t happened yet.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Cassadee-Pope1-220x146.jpg alt="Cassadee Pope Says ‘The Voice’ Tried to Stage a Reunion with Her Father" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK5706GcZqWfqMFuw8Cnq56cXafCsa3UpapmnKKWtG6%2BwJycZpuVobKjvsitsGafpZrAtXnJrpugnaNk</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JazzVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
