While the young singer was buying tickets for a performance of Matilda the Musical, Holden surprised her.</p><p>Holden told Olivia that her mother and grandmother had written to BGT about her. She asked Olivia if she would like to sing for her and the other judges on the BGT stage, and Olivia agreed. As her mom shared, Olivia has “always dreamt of performing in front of people.”</p><p>When she finally took the stage, Olivia admitted that she was “a bit nervous,” but she went on to deliver an incredible rendition of “Defying Gravity” that had the judges and audience in awe. The 11-year-old showed off a powerful voice beyond her years.</p><p>Before the judges even had a chance to share their thoughts on the performance, Holden hit the Golden Buzzer for Olivia. The young singer got emotional as the gold confetti fell around her. Holden called Olivia a “golden moment.”</p><p class=has-text-align-center><strong>SEE ALSO: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">IS ‘BGT’ JUDGE AMANDA HOLDEN PLANNING TO JOIN ‘AMERICA’S GOT TALENT’?</a></strong></p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-what-did-the-other-judges-think-of-the-performance>What Did the Other Judges Think of the Performance?</h3><p>“The whole time you were up there, I just kept thinking, look how effortlessly you sing,” judge Alesha Dixon told Olivia. “It just flows and pours out of you.
