In an interview with <i><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">The Breakfast Club</a></i>, his father expressed how he felt when he became a father for the first time when he was young.</p>With my first kid, I was a kid having a kid. I was a coward, so I ran, I wasn't in a relationship at the time, it was just something that happened. I have a great relationship with Alex, it's been great for over a decade. You have to be there for your kids in every sense of the word. I'm so busy with my career, and sometimes I try to balance both and end up working more. I'm a way better person than I was before.<p class=align-left>Alex Damian Santos' mother's identity remains unknown.

But it would be selfish to limit or prevent a child who may carry it in his blood. I can speak for my eldest son because he has never been inclined towards music. But if Valentino or Solano decide, I will give them my unconditional support. I would advise them and help them to have a musical identity. This is very important. Look how Enrique Iglesias is as successful as his father, and they have different musical proposals.<p class=align-left>However, Romeo Santos' son, Alex, <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">was featured</a> in the intro of his dad's album, <i>Formula Vol. 3</i>, with his siblings Valentino and Solano.
