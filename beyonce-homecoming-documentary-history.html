It includes appearances from contemporaries like Solange, Jay-Z, and former Destiny’s Child bandmates Kelly Rowland and Michelle Williams, voiceovers from Tessa Thompson and Danai Gurira, and incorporates work from Malcolm X and Chimamanda Ngozie Adichie.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">And in her references to figures Nina Simone to Audre Lorde, Homecoming is also a homage to the heroes of black American culture. Here’s more on the historical figures Beyoncé features in the documentary.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">Toni Morrison</h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Homecoming opens with a quotation from Pulitzer Prize-winning author <a href=#>Toni Morrison</a>, reading “If you can surrender to the air, you can ride it.” Morrison, who wrote critically acclaimed novels including Beloved and Paradise, focuses on the themes of race and the African-American experience in the U.S.; she appeared on the <a href=#>cover of TIME</a> in January 1998.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Like many other famous figures in the documentary, Morrison attended a historically black college (HBCU), having graduated from Howard University, Washington D.C., in 1953. Beyoncé includes the name of Morrison’s alma mater and her graduating year next to her quote, a format that follows with other icons.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">Nina Simone</h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">An accomplished pianist and legendary songstress, <a href=#>Nina Simone</a> was a key voice of the civil rights movement and blended activism with her music. “Politics was mixed in with so much of what went on…that I remember it now as two sides of the same coin, politics and jazz,” she reflected in her autobiography.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">In an audio interview played near the start of Homecoming, Simone speaks about the importance of black culture and of her ambition to teach others. It’s a theme Beyoncé highlights in her own performance at Coachella through symbols such as Black Panther-inspired berets and outfits. “To me, we are the most beautiful creatures in the whole world, Black people,” Simone is heard saying.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/nina-simone.jpg><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">W.E.B. DuBois</h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“Education must not simply teach work—it must teach life.” This quotation flashes across the screen, the words of prominent black intellectual <a href=#>W.E.B. DuBois</a>. Born in 1868, DuBois was an African-American civil rights activist revered for his philosophy, activism and advocacy. He graduated from the historically black Fisk University in Nashville, in 1888, and founded the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) in 1909.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">DuBois’ quotation introduces a segment of the documentary showcasing young black cheerleading squads at HBCUs across America, including North Carolina A&T University, Jackson State University and Florida A&M University. Homecoming places great significance on HBCUs —Beyoncé says she wished she had attended one — and the documentary itself was also <a href=# rel=noopener>previewed a day</a> before its release on Netflix at two HBCUs: Washington D.C.’s Howard University and Houston’s Texas Southern University.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">Alice Walker</h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Acclaimed novelist and poet Alice Walker also appears in Homecoming through a quotation: “Our mothers and grandmothers…moving to music not yet written.” A graduate of Spelman College in Atlanta, Walker is best known for her Pulitzer Prize-winning novel The Color Purple, depicting the relationships of African-American women in rural Georgia. The book was later adapted into a movie starring Whoopi Goldberg and Oprah Winfrey, the latter’s acting debut.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">Marian Wright Edelman</h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“You can’t be what you can’t see.” These words appear from <a href=# rel=noopener>Marian Wright Edelman, </a>the first woman admitted to the Mississippi State Bar. Now 79, Edelman has dedicated her life to highlighting injustice and inequality, and founded the <a href=# rel=noopener>Children’s Defense Fund</a> in 1973 to protect children and support families.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Edelman’s quotation in the film is echoed by actors Tessa Thompson and Danai Gurira, who speak about the importance of representation in their voiceovers. “The youth need to see their greatness reflected in our eyes,” Gurira says.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">Reginald Lewis</h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“Keep going, no matter what” was the ethos of African-American businessman <a href=# rel=noopener>Reginald Lewis</a>, who became one of America’s richest black men in 1987 when he engineered the largest offshore buyout in American history at the time. His ferocious work ethic was legendary among his Wall Street peers. His life was cut short after an illness and he died at the age of 50.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">Audre Lorde</h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Feminist Audre Lorde was a leading essayist and critic, whose work centered on race, gender, sexuality. One of her most well-known essays, “The Master’s Tools Will Never Dismantle the Master’s House,” is a rallying cry for solidarity and action in the face of racism, homophobia and oppression.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“Without community, there is no liberation” is a quotation directly from that essay included in Homecoming, introducing scenes following Beyoncé’s dancers on the road to Coachella (or Beychella, as the 2018 festival became affectionately known). Lorde’s message is echoed by Beyoncé herself, who says “I know the importance of us feeling we’re a part of something, like we’re being spoken to, like it’s worth it.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/audre-lorde.jpg><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">Cornel West</h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Provocative philosopher and activist <a href=#>Cornel West</a> makes a voiceover appearance in Homecoming, citing musicians Curtis Mayfield, John Coltrane and Nina Simone as examples of hope. He encourages listeners to be people of integrity. West is currently a professor of philosophy and African-American studies at Harvard University, a leading commentator on racial injustice, and has produced three spoken word albums in collaboration with artists like Prince and Andre 3000.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">Maya Angelou</h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“What I really want to do is be a representative of my race, of the human race,” says literary titan <a href=#>Maya Angelou</a> in a voiceover towards the end of Homecoming, delivered in her distinctly captivating tone. “I have a chance to show how kind we can be, how intelligent and generous we can be.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Born Marguerite Annie Johnson in 1928, Angelou’s acclaimed 1969 autobiography <a href=#>I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings</a> with its profound depictions of personal trauma catapulted her to prominence. Over her lifetime, she wrote more than 30 books and was the recipient of over 50 honorary degrees. She was a starring guest at the inauguration of President Bill Clinton in 1993, where she recited her poem ‘On the Pulse of Morning.’</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The audio clip heard in Homecoming appears to be from one of Angelou’s <a href=# rel=noopener>final interviews</a> before her death in 2014. The clip also featured in the trailer for the documentary, with Angelou delivering advice for “this” generation to “tell the truth to yourself first, and to the children.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/maya-angelou.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmZubWdnf3N9jpucsqeemLJutM6mnJynnZ67qHnDqJqupZWjwaK%2B2GafoqukpL%2B6ew%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JazzVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
