I think that whenever you’re giving or serving in some kind of way, you’re living at your best.”</p><p>The tour will reportedly feature both classic and contemporary tunes. It will kick off on November 1 in Atlantic City, with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">stops in various cities</a> around the United States through December 29. Tickets go on sale Friday, August 2, at 10 a.m. local time.</p><p>Hough is no stranger to holiday performances.
