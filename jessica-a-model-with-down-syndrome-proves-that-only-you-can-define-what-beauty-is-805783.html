Hardly anyone takes into account all the effort that they had to&nbsp;do&nbsp;to&nbsp;get there. Only them and the people that stuck with them through thick and thin truly know just how challenging it&nbsp;can be&nbsp;to&nbsp;truly fight for a&nbsp;dream. And unfortunately, today, this is&nbsp;even truer when it&nbsp;comes to&nbsp;people with <a href=# title=disabilities data-link=tag>disabilities</a> because we&nbsp;still live in&nbsp;a&nbsp;world where canons of&nbsp;beauty are still fairly rigid.</p><p>With that in&nbsp;mind, <strong>Bright Side</strong> wanted to&nbsp;share the story of&nbsp;a&nbsp;Venezuelan model with <a href=# title="Down syndrome" data-link=tag>Down syndrome</a>, who inspires many to&nbsp;also go&nbsp;follow their dreams.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/cff/aec/713fec507ea54cd362a90477c1.jpg><p>Jessica Jacinto is&nbsp;22&nbsp;years old and lives in&nbsp;Valencia, Venezuela. She was born with Down syndrome, but the condition did not limit her to&nbsp;fight for her dreams. One of&nbsp;them was to&nbsp;be&nbsp;a&nbsp;professional model, and she achieved it&nbsp;after many years of&nbsp;preparation, effort, and thanks to&nbsp;the motivation of&nbsp;becoming a&nbsp;true star of&nbsp;the catwalks.</p><p>“I&nbsp;want to&nbsp;be&nbsp;an&nbsp;international model.” “I&nbsp;like the pictures, I&nbsp;like to&nbsp;walk the runway.” Jessica has the personality and mastery on&nbsp;stage to&nbsp;choose her own aesthetics and beauty, aspects that are conquering many people. Thanks to&nbsp;the support of&nbsp;her mother, who has accompanied and guided her unconditionally, her dream has led her to&nbsp;the beginning of&nbsp;a&nbsp;very exciting international career.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/360/b43/7add2d596bbe405f45c1e33c2e.jpg><p>At&nbsp;the age of&nbsp;14, while she was starting high school, Jessica was already practicing some sports such as&nbsp;gymnastics, swimming, and athletics, but they did not really make her happy. Then her mother, Yanira, and Jessica received an&nbsp;invitation to&nbsp;a&nbsp;beauty pageant for girls with Down syndrome, which they accepted just to&nbsp;try something new. “In&nbsp;no&nbsp;sport did&nbsp;I see her happy, I&nbsp;saw that she was wasting her time and&nbsp;I was wasting mine too. When I&nbsp;saw her walk the runway&nbsp;I realized that this was her world, not mine.”</p><p>When she saw her so&nbsp;happy and uninhibited, she realized that Jessica had taken the wrong path and that the world of&nbsp;<a href=# title=fashion data-link=tag>fashion</a> was what she really liked.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/380/74e/02ece450a28c2222b27eb2bf99.jpg><p>“For&nbsp;me, being a&nbsp;model is&nbsp;like studying a&nbsp;career that you like, that you are really passionate about, and even if&nbsp;you don’t believe&nbsp;it, it&nbsp;takes dedication and innovation to&nbsp;improve yourself. The minute I’m on&nbsp;the catwalk, I&nbsp;become someone else. It’s almost as&nbsp;if&nbsp;there was someone else inside me&nbsp;suddenly coming out. I&nbsp;feel empowered.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/ae4/be0/2cf12e5e9e87a525fdbed927c5.jpg><p>To&nbsp;this day, she has taken part in&nbsp;many castings and only once in&nbsp;a&nbsp;modeling contest. She started signing up&nbsp;for these events thanks to&nbsp;her mom’s support. She’d surf Instagram on&nbsp;the lookout for any opportunities for her daughter.</p><p>Jessica has since been invited by&nbsp;local entrepreneurs and designers to&nbsp;model. They all describe her admirable qualities. She possesses great charisma and strength, which are helping her carve her own path in&nbsp;the world of&nbsp;Venezuelan catwalks.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/220/728/5f198c5205baebf75ae5b4debd.jpg><p>Together they have overcome tough challenges. As&nbsp;her mother says, “There is&nbsp;still a&nbsp;long way to&nbsp;go&nbsp;in&nbsp;Venezuela in&nbsp;terms of&nbsp;inclusion. The few big modeling agencies I’ve tried to&nbsp;get her into to&nbsp;give her a&nbsp;push always tell me&nbsp;they’re going to&nbsp;call me&nbsp;and they never&nbsp;do, same goes with some brands.”</p><p>However, nothing has really kept Jessica’s or&nbsp;her mother’s morale down for long. Together, they’ve gone through thick and thin. Her mom is&nbsp;even in&nbsp;charge of&nbsp;managing her social media. “As&nbsp;I&nbsp;would like her to&nbsp;make her dream come true, I&nbsp;can’t get enough, and&nbsp;I know that someday she will achieve&nbsp;it.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/513/afa/04cd9a59b98754268f90565da4.jpg><p>Jessica is&nbsp;not only a&nbsp;professional model, she also participated in&nbsp;a&nbsp;project of&nbsp;the Carabobo-Valencia branch, “We&nbsp;are different, but not inferior”, becoming a&nbsp;certified member of&nbsp;the Venezuelan Red Cross.</p><p>“Being a&nbsp;Red Cross member was a&nbsp;very nice and educational experience, of&nbsp;which&nbsp;I feel very proud. The project showed me&nbsp;that&nbsp;I could do&nbsp;anything&nbsp;I set my&nbsp;mind to&nbsp;and that&nbsp;I could perform various activities. That is&nbsp;why I&nbsp;am in&nbsp;a&nbsp;dance academy, also in&nbsp;skating.”</p><p>“Thanks to&nbsp;the project, I&nbsp;shared for the first time with kids with Down syndrome in&nbsp;various activities, as&nbsp;I have always been included with regular kids.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/69f/022/956e2f5ce2b8fde6bc9273a6fb.jpg><p>Her mother also shared her experience with&nbsp;us: “As&nbsp;a&nbsp;mother, you feel proud that your daughter is&nbsp;reaching her goals. Her day-to-day life is&nbsp;like any other person’s: she goes to&nbsp;school, to&nbsp;extra-curricular activities, we&nbsp;don’t really make a&nbsp;big deal about modeling at&nbsp;home. We&nbsp;haven’t changed our humble approach to&nbsp;life, in&nbsp;fact, many parents with children with this condition have written to&nbsp;us asking for advice.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/5f2/56e/698769531d9df9184d20428334.jpg><p>“As&nbsp;a&nbsp;mother, I&nbsp;advise other parents and kids&nbsp;to:</p><ul><li>Not to&nbsp;be&nbsp;discouraged when something goes wrong and not to&nbsp;be&nbsp;afraid to&nbsp;dabble in&nbsp;new projects.</li><li>As&nbsp;parents, don’t focus on&nbsp;your dreams but on&nbsp;your child’s dreams. Do&nbsp;not feel anxious if&nbsp;you don’t see results overnight, there’s a&nbsp;good time for everything.</li><li>Do&nbsp;not try to&nbsp;make your child be&nbsp;someone that (s)he’s not, let them be&nbsp;themselves. Work and strive. Nothing is&nbsp;easy, but nothing is&nbsp;impossible either.</li><li>Don’t compare to&nbsp;others, the key to&nbsp;success is&nbsp;to&nbsp;treat your children normally.”</li></ul><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/0cc/d7e/3346a755079427671ca846656f.jpg><p>Jessica also can see the joy of&nbsp;her parents for the great effort that, together, they have achieved after at&nbsp;least 10&nbsp;years of&nbsp;hard work and dedication. “My&nbsp;parents are very happy and proud of&nbsp;me, as&nbsp;they see that every day&nbsp;I work hard and I’m very disciplined, every day more and more. And of&nbsp;course, they see I’m happy, which is&nbsp;what they really want for&nbsp;me.”</p><p>What does beauty mean to&nbsp;you?
