Since this tradition always sparks fun discussions, let’s look back at&nbsp;the previous winners and check out Evans’ interview where he&nbsp;mentioned his biggest fan from day&nbsp;1, his mother.</p><p><h2>The “Sexiest Man Alive” feature started in&nbsp;<i>People</i> magazine in&nbsp;1985.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/31e/9b4/09e05b5fb08c2f7b1f2848a402.jpg><p>The tradition to&nbsp;crown a&nbsp;male celebrity with the title “Sexiest Man Alive” began with <a href=# title="Mel Gibson" data-link=tag>Mel Gibson</a> in&nbsp;1985. It&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>started</a> rather randomly&nbsp;— someone simply exclaimed that Gibson was the “sexiest man alive,” and the editorial team thought it&nbsp;was a&nbsp;catchy phrase to&nbsp;use for a&nbsp;headline. Until November 2022, 36&nbsp;men <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>were</a> given the honor of&nbsp;carrying that title, including Sean Connery and Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson, and in&nbsp;2021, <a href=# title="Paul Rudd" data-link=tag>Paul Rudd</a> was added to&nbsp;the list.</p><p><h2>The 2022 winner was announced in&nbsp;both the magazine and on&nbsp;the air during <i>The Late Show</i> with Stephen Colbert.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/a16/5cd/a2d9f2572d9a35e24142f16f69.jpg><p><i>The Late Show</i> <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>played</a> a&nbsp;clip of&nbsp;<a href=# title="Dwayne Johnson" data-link=tag>Dwayne Johnson</a> congratulating Chris Evans on&nbsp;his win. It&nbsp;was done in&nbsp;a&nbsp;comedy sketch format: Evans said that hearing congratulations meant a&nbsp;lot to&nbsp;him, “especially coming from the former Sexiest Man Alive,” to&nbsp;which Johnson replied that he&nbsp;never gave up&nbsp;the title since he&nbsp;is&nbsp;still alive and attractive. The bit ended with Johnson saying, “Ladies and gentlemen, [here&nbsp;is] the sexiest man alive!” and Evans added, “And Chris Evans.”</p><p><h2>Evans gave an&nbsp;interview to&nbsp;the magazine and was quite shy about his new title.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/56e/53d/34ee8853ffa38c4f1435061a4f.jpg><p>As&nbsp;a&nbsp;tradition, each year’s winner gets put on&nbsp;the magazine’s cover and gives an&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>interview</a>. The actor said that it&nbsp;feels quite awkward talking about&nbsp;it, as&nbsp;it&nbsp;feels like “a&nbsp;weird form of&nbsp;humble bragging.”</p><p>In&nbsp;the interview, he&nbsp;talked about things like his career and personal life. He&nbsp;said that he&nbsp;has taken a&nbsp;liking to&nbsp;staying at&nbsp;home, so&nbsp;the most important thing for him to&nbsp;consider when choosing a&nbsp;movie role is&nbsp;the location of&nbsp;the shoot. “I’m too old to&nbsp;be&nbsp;living out of&nbsp;a&nbsp;suitcase for 6&nbsp;months,” he&nbsp;said. His future plans include settling down and having a&nbsp;<a href=# title=family data-link=tag>family</a>.</p><p><h2>He&nbsp;said his friends will poke fun at&nbsp;him for the title, but his mom is&nbsp;“proud.”</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/270/07d/e417fb5fc9b085ce7077a66a35.jpg><p>He&nbsp;said that the Sexiest Man Alive title is&nbsp;something he&nbsp;will be&nbsp;able to&nbsp;look back on&nbsp;when he&nbsp;is&nbsp;“old and saggy,” and for now, he&nbsp;knows that his friends will light-heartedly make fun of&nbsp;him for this. But he&nbsp;also knew that this news would come as&nbsp;a&nbsp;delight to&nbsp;at&nbsp;least one person. Evans mentioned that his mom will be&nbsp;“so&nbsp;proud” and added that “she’s proud of&nbsp;everything her son does but this is&nbsp;something she can really brag about.”</p><p>Evans’ mom even commented on&nbsp;the situation. “Our family will be&nbsp;beside themselves,” she said, also mentioning that she was “not surprised at&nbsp;all” that her son got the title.</p><p><h2>Chris Evans is&nbsp;known to&nbsp;have a&nbsp;close relationship with his mother.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/b70/ecc/bcaebe5caca27c28eea771b243.jpg><p>Evans owes his career to&nbsp;his mom, who has never <a href=#>prevented</a> him from having artistic dreams. When the actor was thinking maybe it&nbsp;was best to&nbsp;change his path because he&nbsp;was scared to&nbsp;lose his anonymity, it&nbsp;was his mom who encouraged him not to&nbsp;give&nbsp;up. She said that if&nbsp;he&nbsp;carried&nbsp;on, he&nbsp;“wouldn’t worry about having to&nbsp;pay rent again,” and that if&nbsp;acting is&nbsp;something he&nbsp;wants to&nbsp;do&nbsp;for the rest of&nbsp;his life, then this is&nbsp;the price to&nbsp;pay. It’s thanks to&nbsp;this advice that Chris Evans accepted the role of&nbsp;Captain America.</p><p>What’s your favorite movie starring Chris Evans?
