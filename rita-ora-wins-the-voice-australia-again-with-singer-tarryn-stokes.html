In her <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Blind Audition</a>, the 40-year-old singer turned all four coaches’ chairs with her performance of “She Used to Be Mine” from the musical Waitress.</p><p>Tarryn actually already knew two of the coaches. She and Guy Sebastian recorded a duet together called “Magic,” and she also toured with Jessica Mauboy. However, she decided to “take a risk and do something new” by choosing to join Ora’s team.</p><p>After she was announced as the winner, Tarryn thanked her coach “for believing in me,” adding, “I feel like The Voice has actually changed my life.”</p><p>“I don’t like to boast, but I have to say, it feels good to win,” Ora said when Kruger pointed out this was her second win in a row as a coach. She told Tarryn, “It’s just incredible. You’re incredible. This opportunity is incredible. Please answer my phone calls once in a while.”</p><p class=has-text-align-center><strong>SEE ALSO:</strong> <strong><a href=#>‘THE VOICE’ AUSTRALIA CONTESTANT SURPRISES RITA ORA BY SINGING HER SONG DURING BLIND AUDITIONS</a></strong></p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-coach-jason-derulo-appeared-in-the-finale>Coach Jason Derulo Appeared in the Finale</h2><p class=has-text-align-left>Aside from Tarryn’s win, another notable aspect of the Season 12 finale was the presence of coach Jason Derulo.
