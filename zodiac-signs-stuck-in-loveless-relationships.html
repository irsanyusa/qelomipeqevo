Cancer</h2></p><p>Cancers are very emotional, and stubborn. They have a hard time admitting they've made a mistake, and they treat a breakup as a personal failure.</p><p>Instead, they prefer to pretend that everything is fine and stay in a bad relationship. They value stability and order, so even if they're not happy, they won't let their peace be destroyed, especially if they have children.</p><p><h2 class="heading-h2 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-8>2.

If they decide to start a relationship, they will try to maintain it despite the difficulties. Instead of breaking up, they prefer to stay in a failed relationship so as not to hurt their partner or harm their children.</p><p><h2 class="heading-h2 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-14>4. Capricorn</h2></p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>Capricorns are pragmatic and practical. In a relationship, they value comfort and peace, not necessarily love. They prefer to focus on work and developing their business, and the partner simply has to be there and make a good impression.</p><p><h2 class="heading-h2 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-16>5. Pisces</h2></p><p>Pisces are dreamers and idealists who can't end a relationship, even if there's no love in it. They'd rather suffer than hurt someone and leave. Unfortunately, they sometimes confuse love with sympathy, lust, or even pity or fear.</p><p>Remember that this is just a horoscope and treat it as a curiosity. A person's character and their relationships depend on many different factors, not just the zodiac sign. Above all, it is important that each relationship is based on respect, understanding and mutual support.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7scHLrJxnppdkuaqyxKyrsqSVZL%2BmuMCtoKimo522sb%2BMsJydnJmjtLR72aibopmTYsCqs82sZKyspZi4brXNZqOorpWhsrS%2FjKucpZmknryvv8eip6xnYayEtbjEnA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JazzVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
