On&nbsp;average, one ostrich egg is&nbsp;about <strong>6&nbsp;inches long</strong> and <strong>5&nbsp;inches wide</strong> and weighs roughly two times the weight of&nbsp;a&nbsp;Basketball. Yikes! Makes you wonder, does the Ostrich hen ever complain?</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/e09/737/85904054fea3437337e12f9fb4.png><p>Just like a&nbsp;<a href=# title=chicken data-link=tag>chicken</a> egg, an&nbsp;ostrich egg will contain a&nbsp;chick embryo only if&nbsp;the egg was first fertilized by&nbsp;a&nbsp;male ostrich. Otherwise, you’ll find only whites and a&nbsp;huge yolk inside of&nbsp;it. The size of&nbsp;the yolk is&nbsp;equal to&nbsp;around <strong>24&nbsp;chicken yolks</strong>! So, one ostrich egg can easily feed a&nbsp;squad of&nbsp;<strong>10&nbsp;people</strong>.</p><p>But ostrich eggs aren’t all that edible. Those who tried them say that they taste a&nbsp;lot like chicken eggs: <strong>fatty, buttery, </strong>and<strong> kind of&nbsp;sweet</strong>. But the flavor is&nbsp;more intense. They’re also richer in&nbsp;<a href=# title=magnesium data-link=tag>magnesium</a> and iron than chicken eggs but contain fewer vitamins&nbsp;<strong>A</strong> and <strong>E</strong>.&nbsp;One ostrich egg will give you about <strong>2,000&nbsp;calories</strong>, while the average chicken egg&nbsp;— only <strong>75&nbsp;calories</strong>.</p><p>Cooking and eating them is&nbsp;a&nbsp;chore, so&nbsp;you’ll unlikely have them for breakfast every day. Their shell is&nbsp;extremely thick. You can step on&nbsp;the eggs with both of&nbsp;your feet, and they won’t break. That’s why if&nbsp;you want to&nbsp;cook an&nbsp;omelet using an&nbsp;ostrich egg, you’re going to&nbsp;need a&nbsp;drill or&nbsp;a&nbsp;hammer. And also a&nbsp;really big skillet to&nbsp;fit an&nbsp;egg of&nbsp;that size. No, bigger. Yeah, like that. Boiling the egg will take almost 90&nbsp;minutes!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/78a/834/581815553e8458800c480ca102.png><p>But it&nbsp;doesn’t stop some gourmets from buying and cooking this delicacy. Today commercial ostrich farming is&nbsp;developing all over the world. You can find farms in&nbsp;the <strong>United States, <a href=# title="New Zealand" data-link=tag>New Zealand</a>, South America</strong>, and so&nbsp;on. Farmers breed the birds and collect eggs from the female ostriches to&nbsp;sell them. In&nbsp;the USA, the average price for one ostrich egg is&nbsp;around<strong> 30&nbsp;</strong>dollars.</p><p>Although eating ostrich eggs may not be&nbsp;very convenient, archaeologists have found evidence that people figured out many practical and artistic ways to&nbsp;use ostrich eggshells <strong>over 100,000 years ago</strong>. Different ancient cultures used them as&nbsp;potter combs, arrowheads, and other tools. In&nbsp;<a href=# title=Africa data-link=tag>Africa</a>, people used shells to&nbsp;<a href=# title=store data-link=tag>store</a> and transport liquids such as&nbsp;<a href=# title=water data-link=tag>water</a> or&nbsp;paint.</p><p>Today ostrich eggshells can also be&nbsp;found in&nbsp;art projects and decor. For example, the shell can become a&nbsp;great chandelier if&nbsp;you cut out patterns and paint&nbsp;it. You can also find this material in&nbsp;jewelry: designers use ostrich eggshells to&nbsp;create necklaces, pendants, and anklets. So, if&nbsp;you ever get inspired to&nbsp;do&nbsp;an&nbsp;art project, just contact the nearest ostrich farm in&nbsp;your area. While an&nbsp;ostrich is&nbsp;a&nbsp;bird that lays the world’s biggest eggs, they’re the smallest in&nbsp;proportion to&nbsp;the body. It’s only<strong>&nbsp;2%</strong> of&nbsp;female birds’ overall weight.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/505/259/c997db53aca3410999fc28662f.png><p>The famous kiwi bird from New Zealand is&nbsp;the size of&nbsp;a&nbsp;domestic chicken but lays eggs that are 6&nbsp;times bigger compared to&nbsp;the normal egg mass for birds of&nbsp;the same size. How does she do&nbsp;it? Another possible rival to&nbsp;ostriches is&nbsp;the elephant bird. It&nbsp;used to&nbsp;live in&nbsp;Madagascar. But unfortunately, these birds went extinct around 1000–1200&nbsp;AD, probably because of&nbsp;human intervention.</p><p>Modern archaeologists have found many elephant bird eggs that have turned into stone. These eggs are the size of&nbsp;a&nbsp;large watermelon and are even more impressive than the ostrich eggs. Based on&nbsp;its size, we&nbsp;can guess that one elephant egg equals around 120 chicken eggs and might have fed around 40&nbsp;people.</p><p>Ostriches have a&nbsp;smaller relative named <strong>emu</strong>&nbsp;— <strong>the second-largest living bird by&nbsp;height</strong>. Emus live in&nbsp;<a href=# title=Australia data-link=tag>Australia</a> and lay some of&nbsp;the most beautiful and colorful eggs in&nbsp;the world. They are usually light or&nbsp;dark green with an&nbsp;emerald hue. Nowadays, more and more local farmers keep these birds, hoping that the demand for these fancy eggs will grow. Apart from well-known chicken eggs, people all over the world eat eggs of&nbsp;various kinds of&nbsp;birds, including duck, goose, and quail.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/e34/4ae/ce9f7f58d8a09fb94f7d36ffb3.png><p>Quail lays small spotted eggs that can be&nbsp;rather expensive in&nbsp;many countries. People consider them a&nbsp;delicacy because this product is&nbsp;highly nutritious. A&nbsp;quail egg contains <strong>5&nbsp;times more phosphorus and potassium</strong> than a&nbsp;chicken egg, and the <strong>level of&nbsp;iron is&nbsp;4.5 times higher</strong>. The amount of&nbsp;<strong>copper and cobalt is&nbsp;also significant</strong>. Although quail eggs are tiny, the recommended amount varies from 6&nbsp;to&nbsp;12&nbsp;eggs a&nbsp;day for one adult.</p><p>In&nbsp;some South American countries, such as&nbsp;<strong>Brazil</strong>,<strong> Colombia</strong>, and<strong> Venezuela</strong>, quail eggs are not that rare and exotic. It’s a&nbsp;common topping for street food such as&nbsp;burgers and hot dogs. Filipinos use quail eggs to&nbsp;prepare a&nbsp;popular street food snack, <strong>kwek-kwek</strong>. They soft-boil them and then fry them with orange-colored butter. Not just birds, but lots of&nbsp;other animals lay eggs.</p><p>Crocodile eggs are not only edible but reportedly tasty and nutritious food. They don’t contain any yolk but still have<strong> many nutrients essential to&nbsp;the human body</strong>. Studies have shown that eating crocodile eggs can help clean the blood vessel walls from fat and improve brain functions.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/573/709/8da4a5586a9d765c7d704430a1.png><p>The obvious disadvantage of&nbsp;this product is&nbsp;that you can’t get it&nbsp;that easily. Crocodiles are one of&nbsp;the most protective mothers in&nbsp;wild nature. Therefore, the safest way to&nbsp;buy a&nbsp;crocodile egg is&nbsp;to&nbsp;go&nbsp;to&nbsp;a&nbsp;special farm. And then the fun starts: How to&nbsp;obtain a&nbsp;said egg. It’s simple. You just reach in&nbsp;there and get the egg. Me? <strong>NOOOO</strong>, nuh-uh. I&nbsp;like my&nbsp;arms the way they are.</p><p>These little white ovals look like rice, but you’re looking at&nbsp;ant eggs, or&nbsp;in&nbsp;other words&nbsp;— ant larvae. This ingredient has been very popular in&nbsp;Mexican cuisine for thousands of&nbsp;years. It’s also known as&nbsp;Mexican caviar or&nbsp;escaroles. Reportedly, this dish has a&nbsp;buttery and nutty flavor and can be&nbsp;rather crunchy when fried. People add escaroles as&nbsp;a&nbsp;topping to&nbsp;tacos or&nbsp;eat them as&nbsp;a&nbsp;separate dish.</p><p>Weaver ant eggs are rich in&nbsp;protein and very popular all-over Southeast Asia. They make a&nbsp;must-have ingredient for salads in&nbsp;Thailand and Laos. These ant eggs have a&nbsp;sour taste and can successfully replace lemon juice in&nbsp;some recipes. If&nbsp;eating ant larvae sounds too extreme for you, maybe you’d prefer snail eggs, which are better known as&nbsp;<strong>escargot caviar</strong>. It’s a&nbsp;popular delicacy in&nbsp;Italy, France, and other European countries.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/f9c/8b6/01267f5283a26805d4e0b71243.png><p>Snails do&nbsp;everything slowly, and egg-laying is&nbsp;not an&nbsp;exception. Producing these eggs takes <strong>8&nbsp;months when manufacturers use accelerated maturing techniques or&nbsp;from 2&nbsp;to&nbsp;3&nbsp;years when it&nbsp;happens naturally</strong>. This is&nbsp;why the price for one small jar of&nbsp;escargot caviar can be&nbsp;<strong>around $100</strong>.</p><p>People also eat unfertilized shark eggs. These eggs have an&nbsp;unusual spiral shape, which allows the female shark to&nbsp;safely hide them in&nbsp;rock formations and protect her future offspring from predators. Chemical research has proved that shark eggs have high nutritional value. <strong>They’re rich in&nbsp;amino acids and contain very high amounts of&nbsp;vitamins&nbsp;E, and A</strong>.&nbsp;Shark eggs range in&nbsp;size up&nbsp;to&nbsp;the size of&nbsp;chicken eggs. If&nbsp;you’re lucky enough to&nbsp;find them&nbsp;— and survive&nbsp;— you can cook shark eggs in&nbsp;the same fashion as&nbsp;chicken eggs.</p><p>In&nbsp;some countries, nearly raw turtle eggs are a&nbsp;popular meal. They put soft-shell turtle eggs in&nbsp;boiling water for <strong>30&nbsp;seconds</strong> with onions or&nbsp;garlic. After this simple routine, the eggs look like ping pong balls and serve as&nbsp;an&nbsp;ingredient for salads. Since many turtle species, especially sea turtles, are endangered, it’s only safe and legal to&nbsp;eat eggs sustainably sourced from registered turtle farms.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/394/613/daf0575a43baf3490ccf570109.png><p>Turtle eggs are extremely healthy food to&nbsp;eat. The content of&nbsp;beneficial minerals in&nbsp;a&nbsp;soft-shell turtle egg is&nbsp;twice higher than that of&nbsp;a&nbsp;chicken egg. <strong>And it&nbsp;has far fewer calories</strong>. On&nbsp;average, one turtle egg adds around 45&nbsp;calories to&nbsp;your diet: that’s less than a&nbsp;chicken egg.</p><p>Fish eggs are famous for their exotic flavor and high price. Iranian Beluga fish is&nbsp;the champion in&nbsp;this field. It&nbsp;makes the most expensive fish caviar on&nbsp;the planet called ’<strong>Almas</strong>.’ This ’black gold’ has hit the Guinness World Records as&nbsp;the world’s most expensive food.</p><p>’Almas’ is&nbsp;produced from the eggs of&nbsp;a&nbsp;rare <strong>albino sturgeon between 60–100 years old</strong>. This fish swims in&nbsp;the southern part of&nbsp;the Caspian Sea. The price for <strong>2&nbsp;pounds of&nbsp;</strong>this caviar<strong> amounts </strong>to&nbsp;<strong>$28,000</strong>! Wow, what happens if&nbsp;it&nbsp;somehow falls off your cracker? Oops, there goes $500!</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZMSpxYywnGacn6PBbrHArWSoq6SntqS0jJ6eoKtdbX50hJNrZg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JazzVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
