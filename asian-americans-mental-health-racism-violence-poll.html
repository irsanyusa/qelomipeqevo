And 32 percent of adults overall said reports of anti-Asian racism and violence have affected their mental health.</p><p class=mb-s>But, Saw noted, increased awareness of the issue does little to fix it. She said it’s likely that the mental distress of the past year will continue in the months and years ahead, exacerbating the shortage of accessible mental health care for Asians in the United States. Language barriers and a lack of awareness about Asian cultures and historic discrimination are also shortcomings.</p><p class=mb-s>“The limitations of our health care infrastructure being able to accommodate the needs of Asian Americans is not new, particularly around mental health care and finding culturally appropriate care,” Saw said. “It’s not an easy fix.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiooqR7rrvRp6Cnn5Oku7TBy61lnKedZK6zwMico56rX5bAqq3NZpimnaKesKK60maknqaklrlutMSao62gXaeupLXSpmSvoZ%2Bhsq%2BvxGanqKSc</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JazzVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
