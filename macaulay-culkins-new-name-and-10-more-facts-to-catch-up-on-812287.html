Even though the celeb life is&nbsp;like an&nbsp;open book for fans, they still have some quirky stories about themselves that not many know.</p><p><h2>1. David Spade accidentally bought Adam Sandler a&nbsp;$9,000&nbsp;dinner.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/ac4/5c9/4d955c52b4bef8f6b260d1e2ec.jpg><p>David Spade recently said that he&nbsp;took a&nbsp;joke a&nbsp;bit too far with <a href=# title="Adam Sandler" data-link=tag>Adam Sandler</a> which, in&nbsp;the end, worked out in&nbsp;Adam’s favor. When Spade found out that Adam was eating at&nbsp;the same “expensive restaurant” as&nbsp;he&nbsp;was, he&nbsp;decided to&nbsp;go&nbsp;say hi&nbsp;to&nbsp;his old friend while making some dad jokes for him and his guests.</p><p>After everything, he&nbsp;decided to&nbsp;use his credit card to&nbsp;pay for their bill as&nbsp;a&nbsp;gift for sitting through his jokes, but he&nbsp;forgot to&nbsp;ask how much it&nbsp;was. The next day his card’s fraud department called him saying that somebody had stolen his card and <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>bought a&nbsp;$9,000 dinner with&nbsp;it</a>. To&nbsp;which David just replied, “That was&nbsp;me.”</p><p><h2>2. Jennifer Coolidge faked having a&nbsp;twin in&nbsp;order to&nbsp;date 2&nbsp;men at&nbsp;once.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/795/cf0/8cd2b2587d8ec3907b59c46864.jpg><p>Birdie Thompson / AdMedia / SIPA / East News</p><p>While on&nbsp;vacation in&nbsp;Hawaii, Jennifer Coolidge pretended to&nbsp;have an&nbsp;identical twin sister in&nbsp;order to&nbsp;date 2&nbsp;men at&nbsp;the same time. She said: “Quite a&nbsp;few years back, I&nbsp;did come to&nbsp;Hawaii and when you come and you’re on&nbsp;vacation alone, you can kind of&nbsp;like create anything you want. I&nbsp;ended up&nbsp;meeting <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>these 2&nbsp;guys</a> that were best friends and&nbsp;I liked them both, and so&nbsp;I told them that&nbsp;I had an&nbsp;identical twin and&nbsp;I dated both guys...for 2&nbsp;weeks.”</p><p><h2>3. Christopher Walken has faked a&nbsp;birthday.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/f11/8e6/70db5a5e89b17a4a7519f21c03.jpg><p>Mary Evans / Allstar / Graham Whitby Boot. / East News</p><p>On&nbsp;the first day of&nbsp;the filming of&nbsp;<i>The Rundown</i>, Seann William Scott asked Christopher if&nbsp;everything was okay since he&nbsp;looked a&nbsp;bit sad and disappointed. Walken replied, “Actually, I&nbsp;am sad. It’s my&nbsp;birthday today, and&nbsp;I didn’t get a&nbsp;cake or&nbsp;anything.”</p><p>Scott felt bad after this and decided to&nbsp;get the cinema legend a&nbsp;cake. When Scott arrived with the cake, Christopher <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>said to&nbsp;him</a>, “I’m just kidding. It’s not my&nbsp;birthday. But I’ll say it&nbsp;is&nbsp;in&nbsp;a&nbsp;week and&nbsp;I guarantee you they’ll bring me&nbsp;a&nbsp;cake...” A&nbsp;week later everyone was singing to&nbsp;him and bringing him cakes, on&nbsp;his real birthday.</p><p><h2>4. Gwyneth Paltrow and Cameron Diaz go&nbsp;on&nbsp;secret bikini wax dates together.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/f6a/b9a/89522e5d5a85513b3d6841676f.jpg><p>Gwyneth Paltrow has many surprising stories. After a&nbsp;funny confession, Paltrow accidentally shared that she and her friend <a href=# title="Cameron Diaz" data-link=tag>Cameron Diaz</a> have been attending bikini wax dates together. “Every time&nbsp;I have a&nbsp;bikini wax, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Cameron Diaz holds me&nbsp;down</a>,” she said.</p><p><h2>5. Leonardo DiCaprio is&nbsp;named after a&nbsp;famous artist.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/3c5/01c/ccae4f5373a2554aeaef7c867f.jpg><p>Invision / Invision / East News<span>, </span>Courtesy Everett Collection / East News</p><p>The similarity between <a href=# title="Leonardo DiCaprio" data-link=tag>Leonardo DiCaprio</a>’s and Leonardo da&nbsp;Vinci’s names isn’t a&nbsp;coincidence. DiCaprio explained that while his parents were on&nbsp;their honeymoon in&nbsp;Florence, Italy, they visited the Uffizi Gallery. When his pregnant mother first felt him kicking, they were watching one of&nbsp;da&nbsp;Vinci’s paintings.</p><p>His father took this as&nbsp;a&nbsp;sign and said: “That’s our boy’s name.” So&nbsp;they decided to&nbsp;name their son <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>after the famous artist</a>.</p><p><h2>6. Madonna uses a&nbsp;$600 face mask on&nbsp;her butt.</h2></p><p><a href=# title=Madonna data-link=tag>Madonna</a> is&nbsp;widely known for her great voice and most recently for her young looking skin. She launched her own skincare line where she invented a&nbsp;special $600 clay mask that needs a&nbsp;magnetic wand to&nbsp;remove&nbsp;it. The shocking part is&nbsp;that Madonna uses this mask on&nbsp;her butt. When others asked about&nbsp;it, she just said: “Don’t you want <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>soft skin on&nbsp;your butt?</a>”</p><p><h2>7. Angelina Jolie originally wanted to&nbsp;be&nbsp;a&nbsp;funeral director.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/15f/9f8/d90eb3561ca11e344a4f7a7bc8.jpg><p>Eric Kowalsky, PacificCoastNews / East News</p><p>Angelina had dreams about opening <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>her own funeral home</a>. In&nbsp;an&nbsp;interview, she explained that the loss of&nbsp;her grandfather awakened this idea in&nbsp;her: “It&nbsp;sounds like this very strange, eccentric, dark thing to&nbsp;do, but in&nbsp;fact, I&nbsp;lost my&nbsp;grandfather and was very upset with his funeral.” She also said, “If&nbsp;this whole acting thing didn’t work out, that was going to&nbsp;be&nbsp;my&nbsp;path.”</p><p><a href=# title=Jolie data-link=tag>Jolie</a> isn’t the only celebrity who shared what they’d be&nbsp;if&nbsp;they weren’t famous: <a href=# title="Miley Cyrus" data-link=tag>Miley Cyrus</a> wanted to&nbsp;be&nbsp;a&nbsp;wedding planner, and <a href=#>Tom Felton wanted to&nbsp;be&nbsp;a&nbsp;violinist</a>.</p><p><h2>8. Jennifer Lopez’s Versace dress is&nbsp;what inspired the creation of&nbsp;Google Image Search.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/1e8/a18/50e5f85f79bf583f0e3131211e.jpg><p>MIGUEL MEDINA / AFP / East News</p><p>Back in&nbsp;2000, <a href=# title="Jennifer Lopez" data-link=tag>Jennifer Lopez</a> and her green Versace dress created internet history.

Everyone was trying to&nbsp;look up&nbsp;her dress.</p><p><a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Former Google CEO confirmed</a>: “People wanted more than just text.

Katy Perry collects the hair of&nbsp;fellow celebs as&nbsp;friendship talismans.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/522/706/f4e7aa5078ae520f2487beba53.jpg><p>MORA / Everett Collection / East News<span>, </span>PerrySidneyTelstra / East News</p><p>Katy Perry has always been famous for her extravagant actions, which have made her stand out from the crowd. However, there’s an&nbsp;unknown fact about her. Katy <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>collects locks of&nbsp;hair</a> from her celebrity friends as&nbsp;friend talismans.</p><p>“One of&nbsp;the first times&nbsp;I went to&nbsp;the Grammys, I&nbsp;got to&nbsp;share a&nbsp;dressing room with Miley Cyrus and Taylor Swift,” she said. “I&nbsp;asked each of&nbsp;them for a&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>lock of&nbsp;their hair</a>, which is&nbsp;totally creepy but awesome.” This isn’t Katy Perry’s only quirky ritual: she also <a href=#>brushes her teeth at&nbsp;least 3&nbsp;times a&nbsp;day</a>.</p><p><h2>10. Jeremy Renner was a&nbsp;makeup artist before acting.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/af3/3b7/fff5d55164930e803406b443a2.jpg><p>Zade Rosenthal / Columbia Pictures / Courtesy Everett Collection / East News</p><p>Before laying hands on&nbsp;a&nbsp;bow and arrow, Jeremy worked as&nbsp;a&nbsp;makeup artist. Due to&nbsp;his theater background this was an&nbsp;easy way for him <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>to&nbsp;make money</a>.</p><p>“I&nbsp;could do&nbsp;makeup because&nbsp;I did theater... I&nbsp;could paint and&nbsp;I could draw, so&nbsp;I’m like, ’OK, I’ll do&nbsp;makeup on&nbsp;girls all day...’ It&nbsp;bought me&nbsp;a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;free time to&nbsp;go&nbsp;audition when&nbsp;I needed to&nbsp;because&nbsp;I only had to&nbsp;work a&nbsp;few hours a&nbsp;week. I&nbsp;didn’t have to&nbsp;wait tables, so&nbsp;it&nbsp;was actually a&nbsp;great gig.”</p><p><h2>11.
