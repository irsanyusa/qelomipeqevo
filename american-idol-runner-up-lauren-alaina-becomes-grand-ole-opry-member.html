The Season 10 American Idol runner-up was asked to join during her recent concert when her hero Trisha Yearwood surprised her on stage.</strong></p><p>What looked to be a compilation of surprise video calls to wish the audience a happy holiday, turned into an actual in-person surprise from Yearwood.</p><p>Holiday joy took over the room once it was announced that Alaina’s father was also in attendance. This surprise brought tears to the country singer’s eyes.</p><p>The singer was just 15 years old when she first appeared on Idol. Over the past 10 years, Alaina released three studio albums and held countless positions on the country music charts.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" readability=2><p>https://www.instagram.com/tv/CXr2QGwDrgK/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-trisha-yearwood-invites-lauren-alaina-to-become-a-member-of-the-grand-ole-opry>Trisha Yearwood Invites Lauren Alaina to Become a Member of The Grand Ole Opry</h2><p>After emerging from backstage, Yearwood asked Alaina to become “the newest member of the Grand Ole Opry family.” Alaina was clearly overwhelmed with the invitation. The country star was speechless and could barely make it through the rest of her music set. Many people can understand her emotion, the Grand Ole Opry is an American national treasure that has been around since 1925.</p><p>“You are the real deal. You’ve played here over 50 times. It is obvious what it means to you… Country Music is in good hands with you,” Yearwood said on stage.</p><p>Good thing for social media. When Lauren was finally able to get her words together she posted what I am sure she wished she was able to say live on stage.</p><p>“What words can I use to convey what this means to me? The&nbsp;@opry&nbsp;is the most magical place on earth. It takes my breath away every single time I step out on that stage. It has been my biggest dream in my career to become an official member of the Opry family,” <a href=#>Alaina</a> posted on Instagram.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Screen-Shot-2021-12-20-at-5.05.jpg alt="Kelly Clarkson Presents Jewel with ‘The Masked Singer’ Golden Mask Trophy" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57wKacq6GTlrtutcOoo2aqpaO7pr6MrqdmpJGqv6a6jJqjmqGelnqjscKopJ6rXZy%2ForrDZqalnV2kvbPFjKacppqVp3w%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JazzVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
