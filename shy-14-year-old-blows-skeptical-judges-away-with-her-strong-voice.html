The judges and audience were not expecting much from the shy singer, but she quickly</strong> <strong>blew them away when she sang “Mercy” by Duffy. The judges eventually felt bad for judging her so soon. Even Natalie Bassingthwaighte apologized for assuming her audition wasn’t going to meet expectations. Watch the shocking audition below.</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-shiane-gets-judged-by-natalie-bassingthwaighte>Shiane Gets Judged by Natalie Bassingthwaighte</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><p>Shiane was automatically being critiqued by audience members when she stepped on the stage. The judges also start being a bit too tough on her. “Your taking a big step here” they said. They also weren’t impressed to hear that she doesn’t have a lot of singing experience, only performing in local competitions. “This should be interesting” comments Natalie Bassingthwaighte.</p><p>The cameras also caught many people laughing at her and giving her dirty looks before she began singing. That quickly changed the minute Shiane started performing the famous Duffy song. The audience went ballistic at her very strong voice for someone of her age. Even <a href=#>Mel B </a>says that she got chills just from listening to Shiane. After she sang she got a standing ovation from the judges.</p><p class=has-text-align-center>SEE ALSO: <strong><a href=#>SHY BRITISH SINGER ACCUSED OF FAKING STAGE FRIGHT ON ‘BRITAINS GOT TALENT’</a></strong></p><p>Following her performance she got extremely shy again especially when the judges began to compliment her talent. “you do realize you got everyone up on their feet and its because of you and your amazing voice? Your Great!” says Spice Girl singer Mel B. Natalie also apologized for being judgmental of her before even giving Shiane a chance. “I have to apologize because before you started singing you were so shy, and I was like oh gosh this is gonna be interesting but I apologize that was my favorite audition so far hands down.”</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-shiane-hawke-flies-through-the-x-factor>Shiane Hawke Flies Through the X Factor</h3><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><p>Following her audition, she was able to continue in the show after getting four yeses from the judges. She joined the girls category that was coached by Natalie and sang a number of impressive songs during her time there such as “Beautiful” by Christina Aguilera and “true colors” by Cindy Lauper.</p><p>Shiane unfortunately did not make it too far in X Factor Australia and was eliminated in the quarter finals, coming in fifth place after losing a sing off to boy band The Collective. Even though she was eliminated that did not stop Shiane from singing music as she released a couple singles following her time on the show.</p><p class=has-text-align-center>SEE ALSO: <strong><a href=# class=broken_link>THIS ICONIC ‘AGT’ STAR COMPETED ON ‘THE VOICE AUSTRALIA’ TWICE WHAT IS HE DOING NOW?</a></strong></p><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-returning-to-normal-life-in-darwin>Returning to Normal Life in Darwin</h3><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><p>After X factor Shiane wanted to finish her education at Darwin High School. While she was in school, she released <a href=# class=broken_link>her first single</a> “Blurred Identity” and says that the song is meant for fans to get to know her a bit better. “It’s sort of a personal song about me and my identity and time on the X-Factor, its let people see me and not the shy 14-year-old girl everyone knows.” She released four singles following “Blurred Identity”, the most recent one being “Prison Cell” in 2017.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Perrie-Edwards-Pregnant-Perrie-Edwards-Little-Mix-Alex-Oxlade-Chamberlain-Leigh-Anne-Pinnock-scaled-1.jpeg alt="Little Mix’s Perrie Edwards Announces Pregnancy Days After Bandmate Leigh-Anne Pinnock" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <span class=title-post-tagcloud>Tags</span> <a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>blind auditions</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK570qGwZmlkYsamrdFmpqWcXZe5sMPSZqqknaCptqSty2ahrpyXmsBurdaasGavmam1brTEq2SsrKKku6h51aignJ1f</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JazzVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
