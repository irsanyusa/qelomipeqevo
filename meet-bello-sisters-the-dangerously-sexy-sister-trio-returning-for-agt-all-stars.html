As they come back in the international stage, they hope to be a step closer their vision.</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-acrobatics-runs-in-the-blood-of-the-bello-sisters>Acrobatics Runs in the Blood of the Bello Sisters</h2><p>Loren, Celine and Joline <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Bello</a> are acrobatic siblings who knocked both the audiences off their feet during AGT season 15. Their audition consisted of body-twisting gymnastic tricks to Britney Spears’ “Toxic.” This act was impossibly amazing, leaving all four judges’ eyes popping until the last second.</p><p>With that foolproof talent execution, it’s no surprise that their talent is a combination of grit and genetics. The Bello Sisters actually came from an eighth generation circus family. For 12 years, their father Steven served as an acrobatic expert in Cirque du Soleil, performing flips in somersaults during Icarian Games. Meanwhile, their mother made history as the first woman on earth to walk on a highwire without stilts.</p><p>Having this impressive family background, the three began training as soon as they could walk. Interestingly, their almost three-minute performance during audition took three years to master. The Bello Sisters reached the Finale of the competition. Unfortunately, they didn’t obtain enough votes to enter the Top 5, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Alan Silva</a> continued into the next round instead of them.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading>AGT All-Stars is Their Sixth Got Talent Competition</h2><p>It wasn’t enough for the Bello Sisters to be in front of a huge American crowd. After AGT season 15, they took their shot in Das Supertalent 2020, the German franchise of Got Talent. Apparently, their stint during this series was cut short.</p><p>They subsequently tried their luck in Italia’s Got Talent as Beautiful Sisters, remarkably reaching the show’s Finale. Despite so, they lost to several contestants, ultimately placing twelfth in the competition.</p><p>Following their long run in IGT, they sought destiny in Romanii Au Talent and Got Talent España, fascinating both crowds multiple times. Yet, the odds still failed to be in their favor.</p><p>However, the Bello Sisters weren’t built weak but fearless. This year, they will be among the 60 talented acts competing for the winning title and large cash prize on <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">AGT All-Stars</a>. This will be the sixth Got Talent series that they will compete on. To know if the Bello Sisters will advance to the competition, be sure to tune in on January 2, 2023 on NBC.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Canadas-Got-Talent-220x147.jpg alt="‘Canada’s Got Talent’ Season 2 Will Premiere in March" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57zJ6crWWSmrmtu4ysoKyslafAbsDHnmSdmZ6csrO71KyjsmWjmsW6edKiqq2domLBs7XOZqmerKWnu6q6xmadqKpdlrS1ecClo2arpJa%2FtHs%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JazzVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
