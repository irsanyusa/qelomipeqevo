After Cabello took three artists from him, Legend finally got a win at the end of the night.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-camila-cabello-vs-john-legend-on-the-voice>Camila Cabello vs. John Legend on ‘The Voice’</h2><p>The night started with a <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">four-chair turn for Andrew Igbokidi</a>, who wowed with a rendition of “When the Party’s Over” by Billie Eilish. Andrew admitted that he originally thought he was going to choose Legend’s team, but he ended up picking Cabello because he liked her background on a competition show.</p><p>Later in the show, 18-year-old Ava Lynn Thuresson shared a unique, edgy rendition of “…Baby One More Time” by Britney Spears. It was enough to make both Legend and Cabello turn around. However, Ava Lynn chose to join Team Camila, prompting Legend to call her “tough competition.”</p><p>The rivalry continued as another 18-year-old, Sasha Hurtado, took the stage to sing “River” by Bishop Briggs. Once again, both Legend and Cabello turned around. Sasha chose to join Team Camila, prompting Blake Shelton to say that Legend can’t beat her.</p><p>Cabello now has three four-chair turns on her team, including last week’s artists Morgan Myles and Orlando Mendez. Her team is shaping up to be incredibly strong this season.</p><p class=has-text-align-center><strong>SEE ALSO: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">ALL OF THE SEASON 22 ‘THE VOICE’ COACH GIFTS RANKED</a></strong></p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-four-chair-turn-morgan-taylor-joins-team-legend>Four-Chair Turn Morgan Taylor Joins Team Legend</h3><p>At the end of the night, Legend finally beat Cabello to get 20-year-old Morgan Taylor on his team. Morgan shared her experience with anxiety before taking the stage for a powerhouse performance of “Cuz I Love You” by Lizzo, turning all four coaches’ chairs.</p><p>Morgan said she initially thought she knew who she was going to pick, but the coaches’ pitches made her unsure. She eventually chose to join Team Legend, which prompted the coach to admit he was “tired of losing to Camila.” Cabello was a good sport, admitting that she “can’t win them all.”</p><p>Other standout auditions from Monday’s show included married couple The Dryes, who performed “Islands in the Stream.” Blake Shelton and Gwen Stefani both turned, and they commented on how appropriate it was that <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">the married coaches</a> were fighting over duo. The Dryes ended up choosing Team Blake.</p><p>Madison Hughes also gave a great performance of “Knockin’ on Heaven’s Door,” turning three coaches’ chairs (Stefani, Shelton, and Cabello). Cabello joked that she was in a “marriage sandwich.” Madison ended up also joining Team Blake.</p><p>We’ll get to see even more Blind Auditions when The Voice Season 22 returns Tuesday night on NBC at 8/7c.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Original_CharliePuth_GlobalCitzen_Kevin-MazurGetty-Images-for-Global-Citizen.jpg alt="Charlie Puth Releases New Track From Upcoming Album" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <span class=title-post-tagcloud>Tags</span> <a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>camila cabello</a><a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>The Voice</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK5706GcZq6fnrCmedGempqoXZiurrXLmmScmZKaua27jKyfoqaVqHqiv4ybo6KmlGKutrDIraCopqNisLC606Klrp1f</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JazzVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
