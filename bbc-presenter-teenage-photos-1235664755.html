The Sun wrote, quoting the alleged victim’s mother who claimed to have seen the presenter on her child’s phone: “leaning forward, getting ready for my child to perform for him.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">The mother’s claims are in a sworn affidavit provided to The Sun, the tabloid said, adding that the young person’s family complained to the BBC on May 19.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">A BBC spokesperson told Variety: “We treat any allegations very seriously and we have processes in place to proactively deal with them.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“As part of that, if we receive information that requires further investigation or examination we will take steps to do this. That includes actively attempting to speak to those who have contacted us in order to seek further detail and understanding of the situation.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“If we get no reply to our attempts or receive no further contact that can limit our ability to progress things but it does not mean our enquiries stop. If, at any point, new information comes to light or is provided – including via newspapers – this will be acted upon appropriately, in line with internal processes.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Meanwhile, several BBC presenters have taken to social media to deny that they are the star presenter, including Rylan Clark, Jeremy Vine and <a href=# id=auto-tag_gary-lineker data-tag=gary-lineker>Gary Lineker</a>.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Hate to disappoint the haters but it’s not me.</p>— Gary Lineker (@GaryLineker) <a href=# rel=nofollow>July 8, 2023</a></figure><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Not sure why my names floating about but re that story in the sun- that ain’t me babe.
