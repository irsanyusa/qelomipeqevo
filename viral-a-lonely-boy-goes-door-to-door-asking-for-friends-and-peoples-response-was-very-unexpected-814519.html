And yet, a&nbsp;doorbell <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>camera</a> caught a&nbsp;heartbreaking moment when a&nbsp;desperate teen was doing exactly that. Luckily, little did he&nbsp;know what an&nbsp;unexpected turn his story would have and how much help and support he&nbsp;would eventually receive.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/864/4ff/8379c9511c9bb3d386c766ce4c.jpg><p>It&nbsp;all started when one sunny day a&nbsp;young boy approached his neighbor’s house and timidly knocked on&nbsp;the door. The boy asked a&nbsp;man living there whether he&nbsp;knew any children between the ages of&nbsp;11&nbsp;and 12&nbsp;living around.</p><p>“I&nbsp;need some friends, like, really bad,” said the kid. And that was the least Brennan Ray, the house owner, unexpected to&nbsp;hear. “I&nbsp;could hear the innocence and vulnerability in&nbsp;his voice,” he&nbsp;said. “All I&nbsp;knew is&nbsp;that&nbsp;I wanted to&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>help</a> the kid.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/fd2/c9b/c276955412b3d4ca644424b1c5.jpg><p>Ray directed the boy to&nbsp;a&nbsp;house down the road, where he&nbsp;knew two kids lived. But Shayden Walker, a&nbsp;boy in&nbsp;a&nbsp;Jaws T-shirt, said that he&nbsp;didn’t play with those kids because they were rude to&nbsp;him. “Well, um, they’re not my&nbsp;friends anymore,” he&nbsp;said and then asked if&nbsp;Ray had any children too.</p><p>Unfortunately for the kid, Ray had a&nbsp;two-year-old daughter. Though the boy himself was really happy to&nbsp;hear that. “Oh, OK&nbsp;that’s great,” he&nbsp;replied, hopefully. “I&nbsp;love two-year-olds to&nbsp;be&nbsp;honest, they’re just the cutest things&nbsp;I have ever known.” And told how he&nbsp;enjoyed playing with his younger sister when she was <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>two</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/c44/2e1/788e3a5485a436727355cf39c4.jpg><p>Ray promised to&nbsp;say “hi” to&nbsp;the boy every time he&nbsp;would see him in&nbsp;town. “Ok, you have a&nbsp;good day,” said Shayden and walked <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>away</a>.</p><p>Only after that Ray rewatched the video and found out that the boy actually approached their house about a&nbsp;half hour earlier, but shied <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>away</a>. And still, he&nbsp;eventually found some courage to&nbsp;ring and ask for help a&nbsp;bit later. Ray couldn’t stop thinking about the poor boy long after that.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/d71/630/f1bb9458a2b03fa9da0937ab4d.jpg><p>Ray and his wife decided to&nbsp;start a&nbsp;GoFundMe for the boy to&nbsp;help him get a&nbsp;dope gaming setup, some school clothes, and amusement park tickets. “Let’s come together and show him he’s got some friends,” they wrote on&nbsp;the website.</p><p>The <a href=# title=fundraiser data-link=tag>fundraiser</a> quickly netted more than $37,000 for the boy and his <a href=# title=family data-link=tag>family</a> when suddenly Shayden’s mom asked to&nbsp;stop donations. She said that they were not seeking any money and shared how their son enjoys playing his PlayStation and other <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>games</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/45c/acd/769e5c534d98359e9e2381c355.jpg><p>Anyway, huge support from people around the world helped the boy become a&nbsp;“totally different kid.” In&nbsp;another <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>video</a> Shayden himself said, “Y’all have touched my&nbsp;heart so&nbsp;much, it’s just literally to&nbsp;the point where&nbsp;I want to&nbsp;cry.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/3e0/21a/10144654ad8b72050491c666f5.jpg><p>Many people sent not only money but very warm cheer-ups to&nbsp;the kid. One comment said, “You are incredibly brave to&nbsp;be&nbsp;putting yourself out there and actively looking for friends instead of&nbsp;staying in&nbsp;the house.” One more said. “I&nbsp;have never wanted to&nbsp;hug a&nbsp;kid so&nbsp;bad in&nbsp;my&nbsp;life.”</p><p>Another person added, “This kid, like many, is&nbsp;special and just wants a&nbsp;place in&nbsp;this world... this family shared a&nbsp;memorable moment with the world, and it&nbsp;was beautiful!!! Our kids need genuine kindness.” Parents thanked all these people saying they were not expecting such a&nbsp;huge level of&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>support</a>.</p><p>The money people raised will remain in&nbsp;the GoFundMe until Shayden’s mom says otherwise. And we&nbsp;hope it&nbsp;will really help the kid one day, or&nbsp;they will donate it&nbsp;to&nbsp;other kids in&nbsp;a&nbsp;similar situation. Maybe after a&nbsp;while, they will use it&nbsp;on&nbsp;other <a href=#>good deeds</a> this world needs so&nbsp;much.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZMOqvsClZJplnKS7prjYZpmosV2cvKa%2FjJ2mqKpdqbxusM6oqWaZo6C2r7OMn6arZZantqa6w6xkmqaUYr2mu8%2BlnKxloprAsbvNrJxmr5Goerex0bJkrqaVrb2mr9Oem2ZwYWmCcoWO</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JazzVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
