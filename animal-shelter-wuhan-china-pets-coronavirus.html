Like thousands of other animals abandoned during the city of 11 million’s <a href=#>76-day coronavirus lockdown</a> earlier this year, the pup was destined to be destroyed.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">But the policeman took pity and instead passed Sweetie to Li Heng, a volunteer for the <a href=# rel=noopener>Furry Angels Haven</a> animal shelter. Taking her in wasn’t a small ask. Li was legally only allowed to keep one dog at home, but due to the flurry of pets abandoned early in the crisis, at one point had 67 dogs and 40 cats in her small apartment. The prospect of neighbors complaining to the authorities was never far away.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“A lot of dogs were abandoned by their owners,” says Li, an auditor by profession.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Vshine Animal Protection Association, which partners with Humane Society International, estimates tens of thousands of dogs and cats were dumped across Hubei province, of which Wuhan is the capital. The Wuhan lockdown started just before Chinese New Year. Residents who had only planned to be away for a few days’ holiday suddenly found themselves unable to return to the city for weeks, with nobody to care for their pets. Other pet owners, trapped in the city, were unable or unwilling to care for their animals under the unprecedented circumstances of a strict lockdown.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“And some dog owners were infected with COVID-19 and were isolated and treated,” Li adds. “So those owners left them in residential complexes. After hearing about this, I couldn’t let them be.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Thankfully, things in Hubei have now improved. No longer in lockdown, <a href=#>Wuhan has roared</a> back to life. And thanks to a $20,000 donation from U.S.-based animal charity SPCA International, Furry Angels Haven has brand new premises on farmland outside the city. Around 180 dogs and 40 cats roam the spacious house and yard, where they receive plenty of food and basic medical attention.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“Now more than ever, we believe it is critical to help shelters like Furry Angels Haven Wuhan, who are persevering through unprecedented obstacles to preserve the safety and well-being of animals,” SPCA International tells TIME in a statement.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">Adopting pets in the pandemic</h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">In China, pet ownership is a <a href=#>relatively new phenomenon,</a> though growing quickly with an estimated 150 million animal companions across the country today. China’s pet industry was <a href=# rel=noopener>projected</a> to be worth $30 billion in 2020 before the coronavirus hit.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Mary Peng, founder of the International Center for Veterinary Services clinic in Beijing, says a “silver lining” of the crisis is that Chinese society is more aware of zoonotic diseases and the risks associated with <a href=#>eating dogs</a> and <a href=#>other animals of murky provenance</a>.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“It’s making people a little more careful about their choices, and food choices especially,” she says.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Still, major problems persist—and not just in Hubei or China. Across the globe, the pandemic has seen spikes in pet abandonment and has devastated local animal shelters, leaving immense challenges such as food shortages, overcrowding, and significant fears of culling.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">In China, animal charities face a bottleneck as they typically prefer to send rescued pets to Western nations with a strong tradition of pet ownership, given return rates for domestically adopted pets are around 80%.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“In the U.S., even kids without dogs know a little about looking after them from hanging out with friends’ pets, but there is just not the same culture in China,” says Peng.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">While sending a dog to the U.S. or Europe, as part of a passenger’s baggage, could be as cheap as $300 before the pandemic, fewer flights now mean costs have soared several times. China’s strict quarantine restrictions also mean fewer people want to fly, meaning “flight volunteers” to accompany animals are hard to find. Airlines have introduced new rules that mean sending unaccompanied animals as freight can cost upwards of $15,000.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Furry Angels Haven used to rehome up to 20 animals overseas each month though this has largely halted. Sweetie, for one, has someone interested in adopting her in the U.K.—but no way to get there. “She’s still very nervous after her ordeal,” says Li. “Hopefully we can get her a new family soon.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Until the world opens up again, all the animals will have to be cared for at the shelter. Although rent outside the city is relatively cheap, keeping so many bellies full and tales wagging soon adds up. <a href=# rel=noopener>Donations</a> are vital to help with food, medicine and other upkeep costs.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“I’ve loved dogs and animals ever since I was a kid,” says Li “I hope that, through my efforts, I can help these dogs as much as possible because they are living beings too.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmZucWFrhnd%2BjpqloqWRoXq0tMSlq56qXazCqa3NZpqhoZ6WerGx06xknKeipLuiwsirrKxn</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JazzVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
