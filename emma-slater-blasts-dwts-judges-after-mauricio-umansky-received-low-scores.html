Following Tuesday Night’s episode, the professional dancer shared her frustration over the low scores that she and Mauricio Umansky got during the Motown Night.</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-emma-slater-calls-out-dwts-judges-for-underscoring-mauricio-umansky>Emma Slater Calls Out DWTS Judges for Underscoring Mauricio Umansky</h2><p>While it’s undeniable that <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Slater</a> and Umansky have had awesome improvements from the Latin Night, they seemed to have not wowed the panel in the latest episode. The two performed Foxtrot to “Working My Way Back to You” by The Spinners. Afterwards, the dancing duo received a 23 out of 40 for the performance — 7 from Carrie Ann Inaba, 6 from guest Michael Strahan, and two 5’s from Derek Hough and Bruno Tonioli.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><p>The judges’ scores have apparently shocked the professional dancer who believed that The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills star deserved better. Shortly after their turn, Slater took to Instagram to blast on the judges’ seemingly unfair scoring.</p><p>“I just thought that’s really weird scoring, it’s so crazy. I just feel a little disheartened, because as grateful as I am for the whole scoring, respect it very much. I’ve been on the show for 15 seasons, it’s really hard to watch Mauricio get down on himself, when he’s actually improving and he’s actually dancing really well,” she said.</p><p>Slater went on to detail how Umansky “didn’t do a step wrong” in the routine. According to her, it’s been puzzling that they got the lowest score of 5 when Umansky “did really good Foxtrot.”</p><p>“I was so confused! He performed that so well, his frame was amazing…his elbows were up and he kept his head to the left,” she said. “If you noticed the hand on my back was closed, we worked really hard on things like that.”</p><p>It’s not the first time that a DWTS pro got disappointed for getting a low score this season. During the second week, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Peta Murgatroyd</a> was caught cursing when she and celebrity partner Barry Williams received a 5 from Inaba.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-fans-agree-with-her-sentiments>Fans Agree with Her Sentiments</h2><p>Soon after hearing Slater’s rant, many fans expressed the same opinions in the comments. A fan stated that only <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Inaba</a> gave a fair score for their performance.</p><p>“Your facial expressions when they gave you scores is exactly how all of us were feeli[n]g,” one fan wrote.</p><p>“So underscored I was shocked,” another fan wrote.</p><p>“So confused with the scores tonight!!! He did great!! Def deserves higher than 5 and 6,” another person commented.</p><p>Meanwhile, some fans were guessing that the producers are to blame. One fan claimed that people in the production might have wanted “some controversy and drama for entertainment purposes.”</p><p>Despite the low scores, Slater is nonetheless keeping her spirits high. In the caption of her live, she emphasized the importance of voting. Subsequently, she encouraged their supporters to help them stay longer in this season.</p><p>“VOTE if you can, it really makes ALL the difference in staying in the competition. My partner @mumansky18 killed it tonight, adore him and his spirit and definitely his Foxtrot,” she wrote.</p><p>Dancing With The Stars airs on Tuesdays at 8 p.m. ET/5 p.m. PT on ABC and simulcasts on Disney+.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Original_ToriKelly_Cindy-OrdGetty-Images-220x147.jpeg alt="Tori Kelly Gives Health Update After “Scary” Collapse: “I Feel Amazing Now”" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57xKakmmWjoa61sdFmmaWZo6nAbrDWrapmoqWZtKa%2FjJqdrZ2iYrqiwdGimqKnXaq6orrSpLBmqpWYsqrCxJ1kpaenYsCku9Geqmg%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JazzVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
