In 1993 he made his recording debut on <a href=#>Mary J. Blige</a>'s "Real Love" remix, releasing his debut album "Ready to Die" in September 1994. The album was a major success selling over four million copies and spawned a number of successful singles.</p><p>After West Coast rap star Tupac Shakur was shot and robbed in November 1994, Shakur, who survived, accused Combs and Wallace of planning the attack. This initiated a heated rivalry between the West and East coast rappers and the two artists continued to taunt each other through their music.</p><p>Run-ins with the law followed before Shakur was murdered in September 1996 in a drive-by shooting in Las Vegas. Wallace's own death followed in March 1997 when he was shot in a car leaving a party in Los Angeles. The case remains unsolved with a number of documentaries and books suggesting various theories.</p><p>Wallace's second album "Life After Death" was released as planned, the title now ironic. It was major success and Wallace became the first artist to achieve two No. 1 pop hits posthumously for "Hypnotize" and "Mo Money, Mo Problems". Combs, now called "<a href=#>Puff Daddy</a>" and Wallace's wife Faith Evans later recorded the single "I'll Be Missing You" in his memory which went on to win a Grammy and become one of the best-selling singles of the year.</p><p>.</p><p class=info><b>Born:</b> <a href=#>May 21</a>, <a href=#>1972</a><br><b>Birthplace:</b> Brooklyn, New York, USA</p><p class=info><b>Generation:</b> <a href=#><b>Generation X</b></a><br><b>Chinese Zodiac:</b> <a href=#>Rat</a><br><b>Star Sign:</b> <a href=#>Gemini</a></p><p class="info no-margin-bottom"><b>Died:</b> <a href=#>March 9</a>, <a href=#>1997</a> (aged 24)<br><b>Cause of Death:</b> <a href=#>Murdered</a> in a drive-by shooting in Los Angeles</p><span class=list-clearfix></span><h2>Career Highlights</h2><ul class=event-list><li class=event><a href=# class=date>1994-09-13</a> "Ready To Die" debut studio album by The Notorious B.I.G. released</li><li class=event><a href=# class=date>1997-03-25</a> "Life After Death" second studio album by The Notorious B.I.G. is released (Billboard Song of the Year 1997)</li><li class=event><a href=# class=date>2020-11-07</a> 35th Rock and Roll Hall of Fame inductees: Depeche Mode; The Doobie Brothers; <a href=#>Whitney Houston</a>; Nine Inch Nails; The Notorious B.I.G.; T-Rex; Jon Landau; and Irving Azoff</li></ul><h2>Personal Life</h2><ul class=event-list><li class=event><a href=# class=date>1994-08-04</a> American rapper The Notorious B.I.G.
