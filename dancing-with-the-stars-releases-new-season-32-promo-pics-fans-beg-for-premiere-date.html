The dancing reality competition series has been teasing fans with exciting promotional content, however fans have been left in limbo regarding the show’s upcoming premiere date.</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-dwts-posts-more-promo-snaps-featuring-co-hosts-alfonso-ribeiro-julianne-hough>DWTS Posts More Promo Snaps Featuring Co-hosts Alfonso Ribeiro, Julianne Hough</h2><p>In their most recent Instagram post, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">DWTS</a> shared high quality snaps of the show’s newest hosting duo. Co-hosts Alfonso Ribeiro and Julianne Hough are looking extremely dazzling in the series’ brand-new promotional post.</p><p>“This dazzling duo is ready to co-host the new season of #DWTS. Coming this fall, catch @therealalfonsoribeiro and @juleshough on your screens, live on @ABCNetwork and @DisneyPlus! Stream next day on Hulu,” the caption read.</p><p>In the post, Hough is wearing a V-cut silver bodycon gown. The gorgeous ensemble is made even more stunning with a bold red lip. Meanwhile, Ribeiro looks completely dashing in a royal blue suit.</p><p>For those who may not know, in March, Variety announced that <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Hough</a> will be returning to DWTS, this time as a co-host. For season 32, the back-to-back champion will assume Ribeiro’s previous role on the program.</p><p>“It is such an honor to be rejoining Dancing with the Stars as co-host. The show holds such a special place in my heart from the many years and different roles I have had the privilege of being a part of,” she said.</p><p>Fortunately, fans approve of Hough as replacement of former host Tyra Banks. Several supporters believe that she will add more value and credibility to the show.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-fans-ask-about-the-show-s-premiere-date>Fans Ask About the Show’s Premiere Date</h2><p>While fans are happy to see the photos of the DWTS hosts, they’re clearly dying to know more details of the upcoming season. In the comments, many users asked when will season 32 kick off on television.</p><p>“An actual date would be nice!” one fan wrote.</p><p>“When tho!? im so excited and impatient !!! lol,” another person wrote.</p><p>Apart from the premiere date, fans have long been curious about the dancing pros and celebrities that will compete on the upcoming season. One fan even responded to the same post, stating that the show can stop highlighting the hosts now and should already focus on introducing season 32 contestants.</p><p>“When do we find out the celebrities?! I’m dying to know,” one fan commented.</p><p>At present, fans are only getting clues by removing DWTS pros who have already announced their non-participation. So far, Mark Ballas, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Witney Carson</a>, and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Lindsay Arnold</a> have announced their exit on the show.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Original_KaitlynMaher_Chris-HastonNBCU-Photo-BankNBCUniversal-via-Getty-Images-via-Getty-Images-220x147.jpeg alt="‘AGT’s Kaitlyn Maher Announces a New Single After 15 Years" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57w5qlnKGenHq4tdOhZK2glWLAta3RrGSrnZyarrSx0malnq9dqLKiv86nZGxqXaW%2FsLnOZqeim6Nis6K60maZnp9dm7yzec%2BrnKahlaeybrDArZxo</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JazzVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
