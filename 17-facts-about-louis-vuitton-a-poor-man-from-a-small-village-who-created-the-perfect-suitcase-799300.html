Its annual sales revenue is&nbsp;$15&nbsp;billion. It’s unlikely that 10-year-old Louis Vuitton could imagine that he&nbsp;would create a&nbsp;world-famous brand when he&nbsp;was helping his stepfather with his work and that, after 166&nbsp;years, this brand would become one of&nbsp;the best on&nbsp;the list of&nbsp;luxury goods manufacturers.</p><p>We&nbsp;at&nbsp;<strong>Bright Side</strong> believe that Louis Vuitton’s story can prove that there are actually not many impossible things in&nbsp;this world&nbsp;— all we&nbsp;need to&nbsp;do&nbsp;is&nbsp;work hard and not be&nbsp;afraid of&nbsp;difficulties.</p><p><h2>How a&nbsp;poor man from a&nbsp;small village became a&nbsp;fashion designer</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/f4b/6ee/e1929b579980952014e48ec1c5.jpg><ul readability=2.3267326732673><li readability=0.94094488188976><p>Louis Vuitton was born in&nbsp;1821 in&nbsp;a&nbsp;small village in&nbsp;eastern France. His father was either a&nbsp;<a href=#>farmer</a> or&nbsp;a&nbsp;<a href=#>carpenter</a> and his mother worked as&nbsp;a&nbsp;hat-maker. The boy’s parents died quite early and Louis had a&nbsp;poor relationship with his stepmother.</p></li><li readability=3.7246963562753><p>When Vuitton turned 13&nbsp;years old, he&nbsp;<a href=#>decided to&nbsp;leave</a>, home having got tired of&nbsp;his foster mother’s strict demeanor. The future designer went to&nbsp;Paris on&nbsp;foot. <strong>He&nbsp;walked a&nbsp;total of&nbsp;292 miles over 2&nbsp;years,</strong> taking odd jobs along the way.</p></li><li>Having reached the capital, Louis <a href=#>apprenticed</a> under Marechal, who was producing <strong>travel trunks for wealthy people</strong> during the period of&nbsp;the <a href=#>industrial revolution</a>. Overall, Louis Vuitton worked 17&nbsp;years for Marechal.</li><li>Starting from 1853, Vuitton <a href=#>became</a> a&nbsp;personal box-maker and packer for the Empress of&nbsp;France, Eugenie de&nbsp;Montijo (Napoleon Bonaparte III’s wife), who brought many other wealthy and powerful clients to&nbsp;him. They became the ones who provided Louis with work until the end of&nbsp;his career.</li></ul><p><h2>His own enterprise, custom-made suitcases, and the most reliable lock</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/986/510/3df797541abc5175ab4a8a6b6d.jpg><ul><li>In&nbsp;1854, Louis Vuitton opened his own enterprise and his first boutique in&nbsp;Paris. The <a href=#>sign</a> at&nbsp;the entrance said, “Securely packs the most fragile objects. Specializing in&nbsp;packing fashions.” It&nbsp;was then when Vuitton created the ideal trunk shape: <strong>he&nbsp;made it&nbsp;flat, without rounded edges or&nbsp;extra details. Moreover, Vuitton’s suitcases were waterproof.</strong></li><li>Due to&nbsp;rapid growth, Louis Vuitton had to&nbsp;open one more workshop in&nbsp;<a href=#>Asnières-sur-Seine</a>. At&nbsp;first, this <a href=#>workshop</a> had <strong>only 20&nbsp;workers</strong>.</li></ul><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/7e0/48e/05633a51f989ced6acb6b20c53.jpg><ul><li>The designer’s products became popular all over the world and served as&nbsp;a&nbsp;standard of&nbsp;quality and reliability. In&nbsp;1885, Louis Vuitton opened his <a href=#>first</a> London store, followed by&nbsp;the next ones in&nbsp;New York and Philadelphia.</li><li>In&nbsp;1886, Louis Vuitton and his son Georges invented and patented a&nbsp;new type of&nbsp;lock. They were so&nbsp;confident in&nbsp;its reliability, that they even <a href=#>challenged</a> the famous illusionist, Harry Houdini, to&nbsp;get out of&nbsp;a&nbsp;closed Louis Vuitton trunk. Houdini didn’t accept the offer and his refusal helped to&nbsp;prove the perfection of&nbsp;the invention.</li><li>In&nbsp;1901, under Georges’ supervision, who continued the business after his father’s death, the Louis Vuitton company released the <a href=#>Steamer bag</a>. Initially, this model was created as&nbsp;a&nbsp;bag for transporting dirty clothes.</li></ul><p><h2>Attitude toward counterfeits</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/713/1ab/20f4875302be938fee245fb9ab.jpg><ul><li>Louis Vuitton trunks were so&nbsp;popular that they soon started to&nbsp;be&nbsp;counterfeited and something had to&nbsp;be&nbsp;done to&nbsp;show that the bags were authentic. In&nbsp;1896, Georges <strong><a href=#>created the famous monogram</a></strong> that was printed on&nbsp;jacquard fabric.</li><li>Items from this famous brand are still being counterfeited even today. The company has a&nbsp;<a href=#>zero-tolerance</a> policy for counterfeits. If&nbsp;you are seen with a&nbsp;fake product, they can sue you, especially if&nbsp;you’re making money from&nbsp;it. <strong>And this can happen anywhere in&nbsp;the world.</strong></li></ul><p><h2>Louis Vuitton in&nbsp;the last decades</h2></p><ul><li>On&nbsp;occasion, the company creates specialized items. A&nbsp;special suitcase was created for <a href=#>Diana Vishneva</a>, the prima ballerina in&nbsp;the Mariinsky Ballet, who can be&nbsp;seen above with her specialized trunk.</li><li>Natural <strong>leather</strong> and various <strong>fabrics</strong> manufactured especially for the company <a href=#>are used</a> for the production of&nbsp;bags and cases.</li><li>The company’s boutiques have a&nbsp;special atmosphere, where every item is&nbsp;shown in&nbsp;the best light. The stores are only located in&nbsp;trading districts or&nbsp;inside luxury trade malls. Some Louis Vuitton goods are available only to&nbsp;<a href=#>VIP clients</a>.</li></ul><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/026/fd7/e9f7fd509085695d2f8b8c406d.jpg><ul><li>Starting from the year 1998, Louis Vuitton <a href=#>manufactures</a> not only with suitcases, but also clothes, shoes, accessories, and jewelry.</li><li>In&nbsp;2019, the brand <a href=#>designed</a> a&nbsp;travel case for the League of&nbsp;Legends World Championship Finals in&nbsp;Paris.</li><li>Louis Vuitton masters also created a&nbsp;<a href=#>custom-made suitcase</a> for transporting 13&nbsp;re-editions of&nbsp;the official match balls used since 1970 and another one exclusively designed to&nbsp;celebrate the 2018 World Cup that took place in&nbsp;Russia.</li></ul><p>Which Louis Vuitton items do&nbsp;you like most of&nbsp;all?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZH54ecWamq2rXZavsMHTZqOorZmoerfByK2rqKZdlnqxu86rZKaZnmKzs7vMZphmq52Wua151aKjpZmXmnq4tM5mmqudkamypXnToZxmqJWns6av02aqrqGkmK60sYxwcHJrYGV8</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JazzVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
