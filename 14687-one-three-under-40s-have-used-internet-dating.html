In terms of romance the story is more promising – it might never have been easier to find a date, and as social stigma around internet dating fades there's every reason to believe the trend will continue.</p><p>When YouGov asked British people in 2015 if the rise of internet dating and dating apps was a good thing, the response was positive.

But among people who've used internet dating services and apps it's got a seedy reputation. At -26 its respectibility is behind only Grindr, the mobile app geared around gay and bisexual men, which scores -40 for respectability.</p><img _ngcontent-yg-app-c2171288495 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ygo-assets-websites-editorial-emea.yougov.net/images/datingRank.format-webp.webp alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p>Internet services match.com and eHarmony, pitched at long-term relationship seekers rather than hook-ups, have the best reputation for respectability – and they're also the most widely-known.</p><p>Online dating is worth $2.2 billion in America alone, and Tinder boasts 26 million matches a day. eHarmony claims to have married a million Americans, but it's founder <a href=#>is cautious</a> about younger hook-up apps – "<span>if the only thing you’re looking at is whether or not the person’s looks turn you on, I worry about that</span>”, he said.</p><p><strong><a href=#>See the full poll results</a></strong></p><p>Getty image</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmixn6q0sMKNnKZnrZtkwLCvyJ6rsmeRp8Gqr8ueqmhpZGuFeHnOp5xmrJinsqZ51KebnqpdaX20ecearZ5lpaiypXnIp6ueqp6awW6wwK2gp58%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JazzVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
