Ansley was just 12 years old when she auditioned for AGT, and she’s now 16.</strong></p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-agt-star-ansley-burns-auditions-for-the-voice>AGT Star Ansley Burns Auditions for The Voice</h2><p>Ansley auditioned for AGT Season 14 with a performance of “Think” by Aretha Franklin. Judge Simon <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Cowell stopped her performance</a> and suggested that she ditch the backing track and sing a cappella. After following his suggestion, Ansley earned four “yes” votes from the judges to move on.</p><p>The young singer from South Carolina was stopped by Cowell again in her Judge Cuts performance, in which she sang “Good Girl” by Carrie Underwood. Even after trying it a cappella, Ansley didn’t make it through. However, she was <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">chosen as a wildcard act</a> and appeared in the Quarterfinals, where she was voted through by America before being eliminated in the next round.</p><p>Now Ansley is trying her luck on The Voice Season 22. Earlier this month, she announced that she auditioned, encouraging people to tune in and watch her performance this season. Then a few days ago, she posted a video belting out Carrie Underwood’s “Wasted,” reminding fans to watch out for her.</p><p class=has-text-align-center><strong>SEE ALSO: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">HERE’S WHAT TO EXPECT ON ‘THE VOICE’ SEASON 22</a></strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-what-has-ansley-been-up-to-since-got-talent>What Has Ansley Been Up to Since Got Talent?</h2><p>In 2020, the year after she competed on AGT, Ansley released an original song called “Who I Am.” She also posts on her <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">YouTube channel</a>, where she has over 16,000 subscribers. Ansley shares cover videos for songs by artists such as Kelly Clarkson and Taylor Swift.</p><p>Ansley also performs locally, and she shared on <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Instagram</a> in August that she was starting 11th grade.
