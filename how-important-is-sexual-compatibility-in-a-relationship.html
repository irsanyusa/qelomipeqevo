You cannot enter into a relationship without an expectation of sexual interaction one form or another. That is why it is very important for couples and lovers to be on the same page as regards what is expected and acceptable when it comes to sex in the relationship.</p><p>As a matter of fact, it is not wrong to inquire into someone’s libido level, and sexual preferences before you get too involved, just as you would ask about their religious, financial and family orientation.</p><span class=image-holder data-fancybox=images-56d91998-6ba2-450b-be0c-0e908d1cee7e data-caption="a disconnect in the sexual vibe of partners will always tell negatively on their relationship.

People will agonize over finding a partner that shares similar political, religious, and family viewpoints.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>“If you absolutely want children and a potential partner absolutely does not, then that is usually a simple and guilt-free deal breaker for most people. So why… [are] so many people… reluctant to consider [sexual incompatibility]… a deal breaker as well?”</p><p>The truth is, whether or not you agree to it now or later, a disconnect in the sexual vibe of partners will always tell negatively on their relationship.</p><span class=image-holder data-fancybox=images-ee306806-35bf-4a3f-8234-6cfd1c946129 data-caption="Stay happy in your relationship, deal with your sexual incompatibilities if you can [Credit - Pinterest]"><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ocdn.eu/pulscms-transforms/1/mMfktkuTURBXy9jMmFjYzQ3Ni0zODlhLTRhOTgtOTQwYy0wOTE5YjRhODFkZjguanBlZ5GVAs0DFs0B2sLD></span><p>As aptly explained by Dan Savage, another American columnist and podcaster, “the relationship graveyard is full of tombstones that say ‘everything was great… except the sex”.</p><p>To have everything else in a relationship and lack sexual satisfaction because your partner could never satisfy you no matter how hard they try, or if they would never even bother to do what it takes to gratify your sexual appetite is a disaster.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>Better take your future sexual satisfaction as seriously as you take every other aspect of the future of your relationship. A refusal to do this might end in the same bad ending you think you are avoiding by paying attention to every other thing to the detriment of your sexual satisfaction.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7scHLrJxnppdkuaqyxKyrsqSVZL%2BmuMCtoKimo522sb%2BMsJydnJmjtLR7x6iuZqGdpbyzwMCnq2aho2LApsTUmqNmm5%2BivaLAyJugpaGkrnqquoyaZKudnJbBqrvNrJ%2BiqF%2BcwKeFwaud</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JazzVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
