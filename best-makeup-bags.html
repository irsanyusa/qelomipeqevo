Because there’s nothing more annoying than digging through your purse trying to locate your favorite lip gloss when you’re in a rush.</p><p>“The best makeup bags provide a convenient and portable way to organize and carry your beauty essentials, making it easier to access and use them when needed,” says LA-based Makeup Artist Amy Galloway. There’s a lot to take into consideration when purchasing a makeup bag to meet your own unique storage needs. To help you narrow it down, we’ve done the research to round up the best makeup bags of 2023—from roomy cosmetic cases with all the compartments to small but mighty options for on the go.</p><h2 id=what-to-look-for-in-the-best-makeup-bags>What to look for in the best makeup bags</h2><p>While it’s easy to get caught up in what’s trending on TikTok or how cute a makeup bag looks visually (and, of course, that’s important too) what’s more critical though is if it’s functional for your life and fits your favorite tinted moisturizer, concealer, night cream, makeup brushes, and other essentials in a nice, neat fashion.</p><h3>Size and storage capacity</h3><p>Size matters. You’ll want to look at the dimensions of whatever makeup bag you’re interested in to ensure the size works for you and your intended use—be it in your purse, suitcase or underneath the sink. If you plan to fill it up with toiletries, skincare products, makeup and more, you’ll need to make sure it’s big enough to house everything in an organized way. On the flip side, if it’s intended for on the go, is it small enough to stash in your purse comfortably? And can you open it and easily see and access everything at a glance?</p><h3>Built-in organization</h3><p>Regardless of size, the best makeup bags should offer some level of built-in organization—be it separate compartments, different-sized pouches or internal zippered pockets—so you know where everything is and can find what you need fast.</p><h3>Durability</h3><p>Makeup bags can take a beating, so it’s worth it to buy one that’s well-made, will protect your products, and won’t fall apart after a few months, especially if you’re a maximalist known to pack in as much as possible.</p><h3>Ease of cleaning</h3><p>This one’s a biggie. Many modern makeup bags are waterproof to protect against spills or equipped with a machine-washable interior so when the inevitable makeup mess happens you can just throw it in the wash for quick cleaning. This is important for sanitary reasons too, as makeup bags can carry dirt and bacteria so you want to be able to wipe it down easily.</p><h2 id=our-top-picks-for-the-best-makeup-bags>Our top picks for the best makeup bags</h2><h3>Best budget makeup bag: <a rel=nofollow href=#>Glossier The Beauty Bag</a></h3><p>Whether or not you buy into the Glossier hype, the 400+ positive reviews speak for itself when it comes to this bestselling, budget-friendly Beauty Bag.

There are nine core minimalist colors to choose from and four more fun shades if you prefer a splash of color (and to make it easier to spot in a <a rel=alternate href=#>weekender bag</a>).

This is one of the best makeup bags if you’re a stickler for organization, as it features a high-bottom compartment to sit all your skincare products and foundations upright, as well as a wide-top compartment for larger palettes, and a compact mirror that folds out for touch-ups. We especially like the detachable flexible insert divider with pockets for the bottom compartment as it offers so much extra and, in our opinion, necessary organization. The nylon lining ensures any spills and makeup messes are quick to clean up.</p><h4>Specifications:</h4><ul><li>Dimensions: 9.4 inches x 6.7 inches x 7.1 inches</li><li>Material: Faux leather exterior with nylon lining</li><li>Compartments: 2 plus a detachable flexible insert divider</li><li>Colors: 1</li></ul><h4>What we like:</h4><ul><li>Comes with a handy foldout mirror for touch-ups</li><li>Dual compartments with a detachable divider offers lots of organization</li><li>Easy to clean</li></ul><h4>What we don’t like:</h4><ul><li>Only available in one color</li></ul><p><span class=best-for>Best with compartments</span></p><p><h3 class=title>Etoile Collective Duo Vanity Case</h3></p><h3>Best makeup organizer: <a rel=nofollow href=#>Umbra Glam Large Organizer</a></h3><p>While it’s not a traditional makeup bag that can travel with you, the storage capabilities of this modular modern beauty organizer (which can live directly on your bathroom countertop or vanity table) made it a must for our list. It has rubber feet, so it’ll stay in place and won’t damage your counters or tabletops. Three drawers offer ample room for all your at-home beauty essentials, and there are customizable dividers for maximum flexibility and to help you keep it all tidy. Stack each drawer on top of each other to maximize space or use them separately, whatever you prefer.</p><h4>Specifications:</h4><ul><li>Dimensions: 10.50 inches x 7.25 inches x 9.75 inches</li><li>Material: Plastic</li><li>Compartments: Three separate drawers</li><li>Colors: White</li><li>Care: Clean with water</li></ul><h4>What we like:</h4><ul><li>Stackable design saves space</li><li>Customizable dividers offers lots of flexibility</li><li>It’s made with recycled plastic for easy cleaning</li></ul><h4>What we don’t like:</h4><ul><li>There’s currently a waitlist (but it’s worth the wait)</li><li>Plastic material can react to chemicals such as alcohol and acetone, causing cracks and discoloration</li></ul><p><span class=best-for>Best makeup organizer</span></p><p><h3 class=title>Glam Large Organizer</h3></p><h3>Best hanging makeup bag: <a rel=nofollow href=#>Tumi Voyageur Madeline Cosmetic Case</a></h3><p>If you’re looking for a high-end, hanging makeup bag that’ll go the distance (literally), the Tumi Cosmetics Case is our top choice.

It also protects makeup from water damage and is easy to clean,” she says. Last, nylon is lightweight so your makeup bag won’t weigh you down.</p><h3>What is the difference between a makeup bag and organizer?</h3><p>“A makeup bag is a portable case for carrying cosmetics, while an organizer is a stationary storage system to keep cosmetics organized in one place,” notes Galloway.</p><h3>How many makeup bags do I need?</h3><p>Generally speaking, Galloway recommends two: “One that you can keep in your purse and use for travel and one for everyday organization.” Some women may want a compact one for their purse, a larger one for longer vacations and an organizer for at home—it depends on your personal needs and whether you’re a minimalist, maximalist or just like to be hyper organized for every scenario.</p><h3>What is the best way to pack makeup?</h3><p>The more you can pare down, the better, and consider packing multi-purpose products to save space. For organization, group like things together, such as all your makeup brushes in one compartment, liquids in another, powders in another and so forth. You may also have your own method of grouping cosmetics that works for you, such as makeup in one compartment and skincare in another.</p><h3>What’s the best way to clean makeup bags?</h3><p>Always check the care instructions for your particular makeup bag. Generally, Galloway suggests using a damp cloth with soap—or even a makeup wipe or Clorox wipe—to wipe your makeup bag down.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmasoJ%2Blvaq6xmiYq6yZmLmme8Geqq1lnZa4psHPZpman6Nk</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JazzVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
