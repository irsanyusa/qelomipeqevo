"By chance he knocked on my dreamy cottage door (sigh), I let him in and never let him leave. He is mine, I am his...forever #MAY212010."</p><p>This raises more q's that it answerswhy was she in a cottage? Was she on vacation? Shooting a Disney movie? WTH was Eric knocking on her door in the first place? Does all that really matter considering how happy the couple look in their pic? Not reallyJessica and Eric are all kinds of cuddly as he shoots a selfie with the sun shining in the background. Jessica isnt wearing any makeup, and she looks all kinds of glowy.</p><p>Maybe it's the benefit of spending 10 years with the love of your life, or maybe it's just a solid skincare routine. Jessica told <a href=# id=a8a19879-ee5c-3cae-a617-1bab75e575de>InStyle</a> that she credits her gorgeous skin to La Mers swanky $180 <a href=# id=a6e56aa6-439a-36f8-acfc-91b24789525e>moisturizing cream</a> and the companys $275 <a href=# id=8320cf31-3052-3928-ac94-d45f4769f434>moisturizing lotion</a> . She also reaches for a much more affordable option <a href=# id=c62ad7e0-f215-3d18-a53b-fbf6e5b2cfab>Epicurens herbal cleanser</a> on the reg. "I love how clean my skin feels after using this gel," she said. "Unlike most cleansers, it completely removes my makeup without leaving any residue behind."</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>ICYDK, Jessica and Eric waited a few years after they met to get married. They tied the knot on July 5, 2014, in a wedding at San Ysidro Ranch in Montecito, California, that was officiated by her dad, per <a href=# id=6aac1475-e82e-367c-a576-b76386860061>People</a> . They now have <a href=# id=0c212474-9320-39e6-a70f-5825787bdf07>three kids, Ace, Maxwell, and Birdie</a> , together.</p><p>Apparently, the day they met is pretty meaningful to her, though. "I count the first day that we met, because it was pretty instant. It was definitely instant. I think he moved in, like, a month later! So we knew," Jessica told <a href=# id=3fb4fed9-b49c-3fce-a40c-cc11b1c1e689>ET</a> . "When you know, you know. Especially both of us. We had been through a divorce, we had other relationships. We knew exactly what we wanted in a person, in a companion, and exactly who we wanted to raise children with. We were that for each other. Through all of this we've only become stronger."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7scHLrJxnppdkuaqyxKyrsqSVZMSwucSnqmaglZa5tbSOo5ysq5mYrm6%2FyKanrKeeYrStu9asZLCgmaGybsPEmqmippdiu7B5zJqinq2gYravecCnpaKulafAor7YZqCnq6SWtLOtzGauoqyYYrW2v8GapZ1naWq0rH7Gbg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JazzVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
