In her <a href=#>new cover story</a> for Vogue, Beyoncé <a href=# rel=noopener>spoke</a> about how her body has changed over the past few years — and why it’s OK that she still has a little “mommy pouch” and “FUPA.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“After the birth of my first child, I believed in the things society said about how my body should look,” she said in the as-told-to interview, noting that she put pressure on herself to lose the baby weight in just three months after having her <a href=#>daughter Blue Ivy</a>. For her second pregnancy, with twins <a href=#>Rumi and Sir,</a> she was more forgiving of herself — especially after undergoing an emergency C-section.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“During my recovery, I gave myself self-love and self-care, and I embraced being curvier. I accepted what my body wanted to be,” she said. “To this day my arms, shoulders, breasts, and thighs are fuller. I have a little mommy pouch, and I’m in no rush to get rid of it. I think it’s real.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Of course, Beyoncé is Beyoncé, so she’s not entirely giving up on her future chiseled abs: “Whenever I’m ready to get a six-pack, I will go into beast zone and work my a– off until I have it,” she said. “But right now, my little FUPA and I feel like we are meant to be.” (A FUPA is a full lower belly or upper pelvic area.)</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">In another section of her story, Beyoncé further pulled back the curtain: “I’ve been through hell and back, and I’m grateful for every scar,” she said. “I look at the woman I was in my 20s and I see a young lady growing into confidence but intent on pleasing everyone around her. I now feel so much more beautiful, so much sexier, so much more interesting. And so much more powerful.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Beyoncé and Jay-Z have been <a href=#>blessing audiences</a> with their <a href=#>On The Run II Tour</a> this summer, with upcoming shows across the U.S.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Read the full Beyonce interview below.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">https://t.co/l1ZsfvaK6G</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmZua2Vtg3KEjpucsqeemLJuws6grJ5lmaPBpr7VopywZw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JazzVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
