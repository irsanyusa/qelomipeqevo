After all, our heroes have done more than simply age: they’ve <a href=#>traveled through time</a> in <a href=#><i>Avengers: Endgame</i></a> and across the multiverse in <a href=#>Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness</a><i>. </i>It can be tricky to keep track of the order of various events when the Avengers are constantly jumping across decades or parallel universes.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">If you’re a little fuzzy on how the <a href=#>Infinity Saga</a>, the introduction of the <a href=#>multiverse</a>, and the <a href=#>ground-level battles</a> between heroes and villains on the streets of New York all fit together, we’ve got you covered. We’ve recapped every movie and dated every important event, even though Marvel hasn’t always been super specific about the Marvel Cinematic Universe timeline. (We did our best to estimate when everything took place.)</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">For the sake of brevity, we’ve left some minor characters. We’ve also skipped over movie plot points that haven’t had any impact on other Marvel films—yet. But perhaps this recap will inspire you to dedicate an entire week of your life (<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">literally</a>) to re-watching the films.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline"><strong><b>MCU Timeline: </b></strong><strong>1940s</strong></h2><h3 class="text-[1.17rem] font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline"><strong>Captain America: The First Avenger (released in 2011)</strong></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/shutterstock_editorial_5885861e_huge.jpg><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The Marvel Cinematic Universe timeline officially beings in the 1940s when scrawny Steve Rogers (Chris Evans if he were 5’4″ and didn’t have a gym membership) gets rejected by the army. So he volunteers for a dangerous military experiment that turns him into a tall, ridiculously muscular soldier (actual Chris Evans). Scientist Howard Stark (Iron Man’s dad) gives Cap a shield made of a powerful metal called Vibranium—which Stark probably stole from Wakanda. Pretty messed up.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Cap and his childhood friend Bucky Barnes fight HYDRA, a science-focused wing of the Nazi Party. Bucky dies—or does he?—and Cap crash-lands a plane into the snow with the powerful blue orb that HYDRA uses to power its weapons onboard. (Spoiler alert: This is the Tesseract with the Space Stone inside. The Space Stone can transport people across space.)</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">In 2012, scientists discover Captain America frozen but still alive because…science.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>Important Post-Credits Scene: </strong>Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson), the head of a covert American military operation called S.H.I.E.L.D. (Strategic Homeland Intervention, Enforcement and Logistics Division) recruits Steve to join a team of superheroes called the Avengers Initiative.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">MCU Timeline: 1995</h2><h3 class="text-[1.17rem] font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline"><strong>Captain Marvel (</strong><strong>released in </strong><strong>2019)</strong></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/new-on-amazon-prime-june-2019.jpg><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Carol Danvers (Brie Larson) a former fighter pilot with Tesseract-related superpowers and a bad case of amnesia, crash lands on earth. There, with the help of Nick Fury and her old friend Maria Rambeau (Lashana Lynch), she discovers the aliens she’s been hanging out with for the lat few years, the Kree, are genocidal maniacs trying to destroy a shape-shifting alien race called the Skrulls. She retrieves the Tesseract for S.H.I.E.L.D. and rotects earth from a Kree attack using her ill-defined but very intense superpowers. Fly? She can do it. Shoot lasers? She can do that too. Destroy an entire spaceship by flying and shooting lasers? Yep.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Carol then gives Fury a tricked-out pager to call her if there’s an emergency on earth. Bizarrely, he doesn’t contact her when alien tries to enslave Earth or an A.I. tries to destroy all human life.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>Important Post-Credits Scenes: </strong>Though <a href=#>Captain Marvel</a><a href=#> takes place in the 1990s</a>, the <a href=#>post-credits scene</a> is set in 2018 when Avengers: Infinity War and Ant-Man and the Wasp take place. As you will see later, Thanos makes half of all life disappear in the year 2018. Fury finally activated the pager that Carol gave him before he died during Thanos’ attack. The Avengers find it, and Captain Marvel arrives in the Avengers headquarters.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline"><strong><b>MCU Timeline: 2005-2011</b></strong></h2><h3 class="text-[1.17rem] font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline"><strong>The Incredible Hulk (</strong><strong>released in </strong><strong>2008)</strong></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/shutterstock_editorial_5885704p_huge.jpg><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The U.S. military tries to revive the Super Soldier program that produced Captain America in the 1940s. Scientist Bruce Banner (Edward Norton, for now) agrees to the series of experiments, probably assuming he’d end up looking like Chris Evans. Instead, he turns into a big, green monster every time he gets angry. Tough break. The folks over at Marvel recast Hulk and like to pretend this movie never happened, so we’ll do the same.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline"><strong>MCU Timeline: 2010</strong></h2><h3 class="text-[1.17rem] font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline"><strong>Iron Man (released in 2008)</strong></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/robert-downey-jr-19.jpg><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Howard Stark’s cocky son Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) has made billions building high-tech weapons. He has no moral qualms about this until terrorists kidnap him using said weapons. Tony builds a gigantic metal suit to escape captivity.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Tony returns home a sort-of changed man. He realizes he’s in love with his personal assistant who he treats sort of terribly, Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow). And he swears he won’t build weapons anymore, except for the Iron Man suit, which only he can control. A billionaire playboy with abandonment issues is definitely more qualified than the U.S. government to decide who to kill. His business partner betrays him. They fight. Tony announces to the world that he’s Iron Man because he just can’t help himself.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>Post-Credits Scene: </strong>Nick Fury tells Tony about the Avengers.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline"><strong>MCU Timeline: 2011</strong></h2><h3 class="text-[1.17rem] font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline"><strong>Iron Man 2</strong><strong> (released in 2010)</strong></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/shutterstock_editorial_5886129ae_huge.jpg><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">This movie is mostly just Mickey Rourke mumbling in an inscrutable accent while a white bird perches on his shoulder. (Seriously.) But the sequel does introduce Don Cheadle as Iron Man’s sidekick War Machine and Scarlett Johansson as S.H.I.E.L.D. agent Black Widow.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>Important Post-Credits Scene:</strong> S.H.I.E.L.D. Agent Coulson (Clark Gregg) drives up to a crater in New Mexico and sees Thor’s hammer in the center.</p><h3 class="text-[1.17rem] font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline"><strong>Thor </strong><strong>(released in 2011)</strong></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/shutterstock_editorial_5885998ah_huge.jpg><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Odin (Anthony Hopkins), the king of Asgard, banishes his son Thor (Chris Hemsworth) to Earth because he thinks Thor is arrogant. Iron Man already occupies the haughty hero slot on the Avengers team so Thor is going to have to undergo a personality transplant before he can join the team.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Thor meets Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner), a S.H.I.E.L.D. agent who only uses arrows because everyone has to have a gimmick. Thor’s adopted brother Loki (Tom Hiddleston) tries to have Thor killed but fails. Loki dies—or does he?</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>Important Post-Credits Scene:</strong> Nick Fury explains to a scientist that S.H.I.E.L.D. has recovered the Tesseract from Captain America’s plane.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline"><strong>MCU Timeline: 2012</strong></h2><h3 class="text-[1.17rem] font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline"><strong>The Avengers </strong><strong>(released in 2012)</strong></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/shutterstock_editorial_5886273du_huge.jpg><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Loki survived falling through a wormhole for unexplained reasons. An evil, faceless alien named Thanos lends Loki a staff that contains the Mind Stone. The stone allows Loki to control others’ minds. It’s strange that Thanos would lend Loki this extremely valuable stone considering Loki’s short resume includes “failed to murder brother,” but oh well.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Loki steals the Tesseract (with the Space Stone inside) and kills Agent Coulson—or does he? Agent Coulson will later be resurrected in the spin-off TV series Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D., but for now he’s dead so the superheroes have someone to avenge.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Loki uses the Tesseract to open a portal between Earth and space and conjures an alien army and a giant space snake to attack New York City. Iron Man, Captain America, Thor, Black Widow, Hawkeye, and the Hulk (now played by Mark Ruffalo) join forces to fight Loki. But the government doesn’t have a ton of confidence in the Avengers and decide to nuke New York because you cannot trust the government in these movies.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The Avengers win by redirecting the nuke at the alien ship. Once the alien ship blows up all the aliens on earth die because…space science. Thor takes Loki and the Tesseract back to Asgard.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>Important Post-Credits Scene:</strong> We see Thanos for the first time. Dun dun dun.</p><h3 class="text-[1.17rem] font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">Loki (released in 2021)</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/loki-tom-hiddleston.jpeg><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Here’s where the concept of “time” and “timelines” starts to get a little wonky. During Avengers: Endgame, the Avengers travel back in time to the Battle of New York in 2012 to try to steal the Space Stone so they can stop Thanos in the future. However, the plan goes awry and Loki winds up stealing the Space Stone, creating a split in the timeline.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><a href=#>Loki</a> begins with a group called the Time Variance Authority apprehending Loki for diverging from the master timeline. Loki finds out that there are multiple possible timelines with multiple “variants” of himself across them, including a female Loki who goes by Sylvie (Sophia Di Martino). Loki falls in love with her (himself?) because he’s an egomaniac.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Loki and Sylvie uncover the man behind the “master timeline,” He Who Remains (Jonathan Majors). He Who Remains defeated an unsubtly named bad guy variant of himself called <a href=#>Kang the Conquerer</a>, and created one true timeline to prevent Kang from trying to rule the whole multiverse. Sylvie kills He Who Remains, and it’s a huge mistake: Loki finds himself stranded in a universe where Kang the Conquerer has taken over. It’s unclear what “year” this all happens, or whether you can really assign a year to that event at all given that the Time Variance Authority is described as being set in the “void at the end of time.” Let’s just say, “Time is mysterious,” and move on.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>Read More:</strong> <a href=#>Everything You Need to Know About Loki and Time Travel in the MCU</a></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>Iron Man 3</strong><strong> (released in 2013)</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/shutterstock_editorial_5885986ae_huge.jpg><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Villain Aldrich Killian (Guy Pearce) kidnaps the president. Iron Man stops him. Killian then kidnaps Pepper and injects her with a serum that may kill her—or may give her super powers. This plan turns out to be as dumb as it sounds: Pepper gets superpowers and then kills Killian. Iron Man is there, too.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline"><strong>MCU Timeline: 2013</strong></h2><h3 class="text-[1.17rem] font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline"><strong>Thor: The Dark World</strong><strong> (released in 2013)</strong></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/shutterstock_editorial_2780501b_huge.jpg><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Some aliens try to use Aether, a floaty red substance, to turn all matter into dark matter because they’re evil and therefore must to evil things. We learn Aether is actually a manifestation of the Reality Stone. Loki decides he’s a good guy now and helps Thor defeat the bad guys. Loki dies, again—or does he?</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>Important Post-Credit Scene:</strong> Thor can’t keep the Reality Stone in Asgard because The Space Stone (Tesseract) is already there. You might as well be asking Thanos to come destroy your planet. Thor’s friends bring the Reality Stone to the Collector (Benicio del Toro). Thor’s friends seem really hesitant to leave such a powerful object with the Collector, which is reasonable because the guy has Howard the Duck trapped in a cage in his office.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline"><strong>MCU Timeline: 2014</strong></h2><h3 class="text-[1.17rem] font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline"><strong>Captain America: The Winter Soldier</strong><strong> (released in 2014)</strong></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/captainamerica252caf98173f6a.jpg><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">This one has a lot of twists, so prepare yourself. Nick Fury tells Captain America that S.H.I.E.L.D. is building a worldwide surveillance system that can kill anybody. Cap rightly points out that this sounds kind of fascist. Their political argument is rudely interrupted by HYDRA agents who have infiltrated S.H.I.E.L.D. (Gasp! Seriously, you cannot trust the government.) A HYDRA assassin called the Winter Soldier kills Nick Fury—or does he?</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Cap and Black Widow go on the run, but they can’t stay hidden for long because Captain America is very handsome and very recognizable. They track down the Winter Soldier only to discover that he is Cap’s best friend Bucky Barnes, but brainwashed. (Gasp!)</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Cap and Black Widow team up with a war vet named Sam Wilson (Anthony Mackie), who conveniently knows how to fly an army-grade winged jetpack. They find out Nick Fury faked his own death. (Gasp!) Together they publish all of S.H.I.E.L.D.’s secrets on the internet. Bucky saves Cap during the ensuing fight proving himself to be good again. The bromance lives, but S.H.I.E.L.D. disbands.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>Important Post-Credits Scenes: </strong>A HYDRA scientist reveals that he has created two new mutants using the Mind Stone. We meet Scarlett Witch and Quicksilver—the only X-Men Disney could get the rights to at the time.</p><h3 class="text-[1.17rem] font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline"><strong>Guardians of the Galaxy</strong><strong> (released in 2014)</strong></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/ft090260_r.jpg><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Marvel elevates Chris Pratt—the schlubby dude from Parks and Recreation—to sex symbol status. He plays Peter Quill, a.k.a. Star Lord, an orphaned thief obsessed with 70s music. Peter steals a not-very-well-guarded Infinity Stone called the Power Stone. Bad guy Thanos sends one of his adopted daughters Gamora (Zoe Saldana in green body paint) to take the stone from Peter. Thanos is extremely lazy and never gets up from his throne for the entire movie.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Peter and Gamora eventually join forces with other lovable misfits—trisyllabic tree Groot (Vin Diesel), machine-gun wielding raccoon Rocket (Bradley Cooper) and muscular blue alien Drax (Dave Bautista)—to prove that Marvel can make money on even the weirdest and most obscure comic book characters. They protect the stone from Thanos and his minions, including Gamora’s half sister Nebula. Groot sacrifices himself to save the others and dies—or does he?</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><b>Important</b><strong> Post-Credits Scene</strong>: Groot doesn’t die. He’s reborn as a cute baby tree. The Guardians hand over the stone to Nova Corps, the Space Police.</p><h3 class="text-[1.17rem] font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline"><strong>Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2</strong><strong> (released in 2017)</strong></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/guardians-5.jpg><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Peter finds out that his father is a planet named Ego (Kurt Russell), which seems cool for awhile until Ego reveals he killed Peter’s mom. The Guardians and an empath named Mantis (Pom Klementieff) defeat Ego. At one point, Peter turns into a giant Pac-Man because he’s kooky like that. Disney sells a lot of Baby Groot toys.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline"><strong>MCU Timeline: 2015</strong></h2><h3 class="text-[1.17rem] font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">Avengers: Age of Ultron (released in 2015)</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/captain-america-avengers-chris-evans.jpg><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The Avengers did not assemble when a terrorist kidnapped the president. They did not assemble when a sleeper Nazi organization infiltrated S.H.I.E.L.D. But they do assemble to go on a road trip to the ludicrously named country of Sokovia, where Loki’s scepter might be. Sure.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Tony Stark and Bruce Banner use the Mind Stone to create an artificially intelligent being called Ultron and task him with keeping peace on earth. Ultron predictably turns homicidal. Ultron recruits Pietro Maximoff (Aaron Taylor-Johnson)—who is super fast—and Wanda Maximoff (Elizabeth Olsen)—who has vague, ever-changing mind control and levitating powers. But the mutants later abandon Ultron and join the Avengers.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The Avengers, undeterred by how badly the Ultron experiment went, create a new superhero using the Mind Stone and Tony’s A.I. assistant Jarvis. They name him Vision (Paul Bettany), and he has even vaguer powers than Scarlett Witch. He’s maybe invincible? And also a ghost who can move through walls?</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Ultron develops an extremely convoluted plan to turn Sokovia into a meteor that will crash into earth. Together the Avengers destroy Ultron but also kill almost everyone in Sokovia. Quicksilver actually dies. Oh, also Hulk and Black Widow are in love now, which is outrageous and dropped immediately in the next Avengers movie.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>Important Post-Credits Scene: </strong>Thanos is finally fed up with his minions failing to attain the Infinity Stones. He puts on a golden glove called the Infinity Gauntlet that can hold each powerful gem and says “Fine, I’ll do it.” This line doesn’t totally make sense since Ultron was neither a minion of Thanos nor trying to get an Infinity Stone, but don’t overthink it.</p><h3 class="text-[1.17rem] font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">Ant-Man (released in 2015)</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/ant-man-paul-rudd-marvel.jpg><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Hank Pym (Michael Douglas) and his daughter Hope (Evangeline Lilly) are scared that their old colleague Darren Cross is going to sell shrinking technology to bad guys.

They were likely together in 2015 when Thor bragged about his genius girlfriend to Iron Man in Avengers: Age of Ultron. But Thor was definitely single and hurting by the events of Thor: Ragnarok in 2017. So if we assume that Thor’s pain in that movie was fresh from a breakup, we can guess that Love and Thunder is set in 2025.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmZuamJshnSBjqaYq66VoXqktc2epJqsmZh6trrIr5yrq5Viwaq5xKWgp51f</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JazzVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
