"Kudos to Coach's leadership on a smart strategy"</p><p>Coach has been using Gomez to the absolute max. In addition to the fan meet and greet, the company used Gomez's fame to boost their presence at New York City's Fashion Week. The company sat Gomez next to Anna Wintour, the famed editor of "Vogue." The "Selena Grace" bag, which Gomez designed, was seen on the Fashion Week runway, and fans were able to have their own bags signed by Gomez at the store's event on Wednesday.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>Gomez is also lending her <a href=# id=05f02fbc-0f75-5f16-9f6c-a19f3089b65c>126 million Instagram followers</a> to the effort. Since announcing the partnership, Gomez has gained 14 million followers and is the largest account on the platform. She has posted several times about her new bag and, since partnering with Coach, has appeared on the cover of "TIME" and "Business of Fashion" magazine. In an appearance on the cover of "InStyle" magazine, Gomez tagged the Coach account in her post about the cover.</p><p>Coach has historically catered to the high-cost, high-fashion industry. With Gomez, Coach is branching into lower cost items, and is using Gomez's name to test items at a lower price point.</p><p>"We think lower priced goods need to increase in velocity for the core Coach brand to be able to sustain comp sales growth," Konik wrote in his note about Gomez and Coach. "Thus in future quarter calls we think investors will need to focus on this &lt;$400 price strata to gauge the longevity of the Coach brand turn from here."</p><p>Konik is rather bearish on Coach, though it's not because of the pop star affiliation. He writes that Gomez might be the boost Coach needs to reach sales that justify the company's share price. Priced at around 18 times the company's earnings, it is more expensive than competitors like <a href=# id=4a8bb73a-35c1-544a-85e5-bf86a20cb403>Michael Kors</a>, which is valued at closer to 10 times its earnings.</p><p>Konik places a price target of $42 for Coach, which right around its current price of $42.06.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>Coach shares are up 18.45% this year.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7scHLrJxnppdkr6p7xaKlmqaTmnyntc2apZydXaiyrbHNmmSgp52ax26tzZ1koZ2iYr%2BirsidZJ%2BZnmKvor%2FEZpirnV2YvKKvx6xkm6GXnLK0wIywnJqon6N6orPAoqWsrF2ptaZ7wquepGhoaw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JazzVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
