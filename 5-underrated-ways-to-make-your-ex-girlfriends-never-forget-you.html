We want to quickly give you all the tips that‚Äôll make you unforgettable to all your ex-girlfriends no matter how many. They‚Äôre all easy steps. And you don‚Äôt have to pay us anything [well, except your attention]. So let‚Äôs go!</p><p><strong>1. Convince them to have a baby for you</strong></p><p>Even better if they can have more than one. This is the simplest trick in the rule book and just like it‚Äôs working just fine for Nick Cannon, it is sure to work for you. No matter how far or wide your exes go, or how many people they fall in love with after you, there will be one living, breathing evidence that you were once in their life. That‚Äôs it - you‚Äôll be 100% unforgettable!</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p><strong>2. Great sex and/or plenty money</strong></p><p>You can choose one of these or both. If you must choose one, let it be proper premium knacks. Anyone can give anyone enough money. Besides, women are rich, they just like pretending. So go for brain-scrambling knacks and even if y‚Äôall break up, they'll still be having mad flashbacks for years.</p><p>Warning though, this one usually works like juju, meaning that there is a chance that ‚ÄòD‚Äô spell can wear off. But it‚Äôs still quite dependable. We‚Äôll rate it 70%.</p><p><strong>3. Get them to tattoo your name on their body</strong></p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>If you can get anyone to tattoo your name on their body, you‚Äôre halfway to staying top-of-mind for decades. Hopefully, they don‚Äôt redesign the tattoo to clear off your name after the breakup.</p><p>Any which way, the tattoo will be permanent and they‚Äôll forever remember that they had your name on them. We rank this one 65% effective.</p><p><strong>4. Steal their skincare products</strong></p><p>Ok, this one is bad behaviour but chill, we can explain. First, it‚Äôll be retribution for all your hoodies and shirts they stole from you. So‚Ä¶ it checks out ü´±üèΩ‚Äçü´≤üèº.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>But most importantly, skincare products cost die and e go pain the babe well, especially if she just restocked. Best believe she‚Äôll be telling this story to her grandkids when warning them off boys in the future. This skincare-theft method? 90% effective.</p><p><strong>5. Make them do this with your name</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7scHLrJxnppdkuaqyxKyrsqSVZL%2BmuMCtoKimo522sb%2BMsJydnJmjtLR7lGasp5yVp7%2BiwMSdZLCZqah6tbuMppiknV2uvLa%2BjJ6vZp%2BZp7mnvsiepZ2rXaOyt7HRZp2oqpeawW7Fzq5mbbCaZn%2Bksw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JazzVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
