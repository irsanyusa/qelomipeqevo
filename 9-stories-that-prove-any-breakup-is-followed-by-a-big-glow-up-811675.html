My&nbsp;feet hurt walking through all that concrete.”</p><p><h2>2.

When I&nbsp;come home, I&nbsp;want to&nbsp;be&nbsp;anchored by&nbsp;someone. I&nbsp;don’t get off on&nbsp;drama or&nbsp;fighting.” The singer <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>finalized</a>, “Sometimes you miss people more than others, and sometimes, things get easier.

The reality star <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>explained</a>, “We&nbsp;paused the divorce, not for any romantic reasons, but&nbsp;I wanted to&nbsp;be&nbsp;able to&nbsp;help take care of&nbsp;him and make sure that he&nbsp;would be&nbsp;ok&nbsp;again.”</p><p>Khloé clearly let this relationship&nbsp;go, despite her ex-husband’s heartwarming <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>comments</a>, “I&nbsp;do miss her and her family dearly.

I&nbsp;would do&nbsp;anything to&nbsp;make up&nbsp;for&nbsp;it.”</p><p><h2>6.

Every red carpet she steps&nbsp;on, and every outfit she wears generates headlines. Megan <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>admitted</a> that the change was due to&nbsp;her divorce, “I&nbsp;had this incredible breakthrough, and&nbsp;I realized that&nbsp;I had been living in&nbsp;a&nbsp;self-imposed prison for so&nbsp;long because&nbsp;I let other people tell me&nbsp;who&nbsp;I was or&nbsp;what&nbsp;I wasn’t. I&nbsp;hid because&nbsp;I was hurt.”</p><p>And the actress <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>made</a> a&nbsp;promise to&nbsp;herself, “I&nbsp;promised myself that&nbsp;I would never live one more day of&nbsp;my&nbsp;life from fear. I&nbsp;came home, and my&nbsp;whole life changed. I&nbsp;got a&nbsp;divorce and&nbsp;I started working more and doing more things.”</p><p><h2>8. Hilary Duff</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/9a3/9a4/8f42685cb68553df82b200600d.jpg><p>After 4&nbsp;years of&nbsp;marriage&nbsp;— and the birth of&nbsp;one child,<strong> </strong>Luca&nbsp;— <a href=# title="Hilary Duff" data-link=tag>Hilary Duff</a> and <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Mike Comrie</a> decided to&nbsp;divorce. The Disney star <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>explained</a> this decision saying, “I&nbsp;think that&nbsp;I was in&nbsp;a&nbsp;very successful marriage for a&nbsp;long time.”</p><p>She <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>added</a>, “We&nbsp;got together based on&nbsp;<a href=# title=love data-link=tag>love</a>, and we&nbsp;separated in&nbsp;a&nbsp;very loving way. I&nbsp;can’t imagine going through that process with anyone but him, and he&nbsp;continues to&nbsp;be&nbsp;my&nbsp;very good friend. That’s honestly speaking from my&nbsp;heart. So, I&nbsp;think we&nbsp;handled it&nbsp;very consciously and with a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;love.”</p><p><h2>9. Kaley Cuoco</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/7b1/c09/8f9df5570985bdd65c151d1ae5.jpg><p>AFP / EAST NEWS<span>, </span>HFPA via The Grosby Group / Grosby Group / East News</p><p><i>The Big Bang Theory</i> star <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>confessed</a> that going through her divorce from ex-husband <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Karl Cook</a>, “was really a&nbsp;super dark time. I&nbsp;just didn’t know how to&nbsp;deal with&nbsp;it.” <a href=# title=Cuoco data-link=tag>Cuoco</a> <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>decided</a> to&nbsp;seek therapy for the first time. “It&nbsp;was horrible. And I&nbsp;developed a&nbsp;stress rash that ran all the way down my&nbsp;body for 3&nbsp;straight months that wouldn’t go&nbsp;away.”</p><p>She also asked her good friend and fellow actress from <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>The Flight Attendant</i></a><i>,</i> <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Zosia Mamet</a>, to&nbsp;move in&nbsp;with her, explaining “I&nbsp;really needed someone with&nbsp;me. I&nbsp;was really losing my&nbsp;mind.” Later the actress <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>admitted</a> that she, “will never get married again.” She explained, “I&nbsp;would love to&nbsp;have a&nbsp;long-lasting relationship or&nbsp;a&nbsp;partnership. But I&nbsp;will never get married again. Absolutely not.”</p><h2>Bonus: A&nbsp;psychologist <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>reveals</a> simple tips to&nbsp;get over a&nbsp;breakup:</h2><ul><li><strong>Don’t grieve alone</strong>. Losing a&nbsp;relationship can feel almost like a&nbsp;death of&nbsp;the relationship. We&nbsp;were not meant to&nbsp;grieve alone, so&nbsp;consider making sure that you’re always with a&nbsp;supportive friend or&nbsp;family member for the first week or&nbsp;2.</li><li><strong>Experience healthy touch</strong>. Our bodies actually acclimate to&nbsp;certain frequencies of&nbsp;touch, so&nbsp;a&nbsp;breakup can feel like a&nbsp;double whammy. We&nbsp;are losing emotional support and simultaneously experiencing a&nbsp;dramatic decrease in&nbsp;the amount of&nbsp;physical affection we&nbsp;receive. While a&nbsp;massage certainly isn’t the same, it&nbsp;can help your body/mind to&nbsp;at&nbsp;least experience positive touch.</li><li><strong>Open your eyes.</strong> We&nbsp;sometimes view our exes with rose-colored glasses, which can make it&nbsp;harder to&nbsp;move&nbsp;on. You may want to&nbsp;make a&nbsp;list of&nbsp;the top 5&nbsp;times that your ex&nbsp;hurt or&nbsp;disappointed you, or&nbsp;other negative points that may help you to&nbsp;realize that, in&nbsp;fact, this person is&nbsp;by&nbsp;no&nbsp;means perfect.</li><li><strong>Fill your brain with new experiences. </strong>Part of&nbsp;why breakups can be&nbsp;so&nbsp;painful is&nbsp;that we&nbsp;may feel that everything in&nbsp;our current environment reminds&nbsp;us of&nbsp;our&nbsp;ex. One way to&nbsp;change this is&nbsp;to&nbsp;deliberately create new experiences to&nbsp;help the old memories start to&nbsp;recede. New experiences can also subtly reassure&nbsp;us that there are other possibilities in&nbsp;life.</li><li><strong>Remember your last&nbsp;ex</strong>. If&nbsp;you’re feeling like you’ll “never get over” your current breakup, it&nbsp;can be&nbsp;helpful to&nbsp;remember previous breakups where you may have felt the same. Take refuge in&nbsp;knowing that you’ll likely move forward and meet another person who you may like even better than your ex&nbsp;one day, even if&nbsp;that seems as&nbsp;impossible now as&nbsp;it&nbsp;did to&nbsp;your high school self years ago.</li></ul><p>Preview photo credit Joseph Gotfriedy / Broadimage / EAST NEWS<span>, </span>ANGELA WEISS / AFP / East News</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZIZuv9OoqaKdo2LBqa3TZqerp6aaeqK62GaZq52RoMKxecisZJ%2BnnKG8uLHDZpmyZZFir6qzjKCjqK9dqr1uhJBqbXBtXw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 JazzVibe - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
