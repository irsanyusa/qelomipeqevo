Of the six barbers at the shop, only one was successful in getting unemployment, Bell says. Bell has applied for a grant to help small businesses and for assistance through the <a href=#>Paycheck Protection Program</a>, but did not receive approval for either service.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp’s decision to allow some business owners to resume operations beginning Friday was both a scary and welcoming piece of news to Bell, who decided to reopen her shop.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“I was scared. I still am scared,” she says. “But I was also excited because we could get back to work.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Bell tells Couric that shop employees are taking what safety measures they can and trying to keep up with social distancing rules as much as possible—except when services are actually being provided to customers. The shop is open during limited hours and is not offering facial shaves, beard trims or shampooing services. Clients are pouring in for haircuts, according to Bell, and appointments at the shop are currently fully booked.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“We are taking extra steps to try and be as safe as possible,” she says. “We hope that we can continue to make them feel safe while they’re getting their hair cut.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">&nbsp;</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">This interview is part of a special series produced in collaboration with Katie Couric.
