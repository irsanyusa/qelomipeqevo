They feel they need to&nbsp;wait until they’re well-prepared to&nbsp;bring a&nbsp;child into the world. However, others face the challenge of&nbsp;motherhood at&nbsp;a&nbsp;very young age, and that’s precisely what happened to&nbsp;actress Sofía Vergara, who became a&nbsp;mother to&nbsp;Manolo at&nbsp;the age of&nbsp;19. With much effort, hard work, and a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;love, the Modern Family star managed to&nbsp;raise her son on&nbsp;her own without losing sight of&nbsp;her <a href=# title=career data-link=tag>career</a> goals.</p><p><strong>Bright Side</strong> loves to&nbsp;share inspiring stories and invites you to&nbsp;read the story of&nbsp;Sofía Vergara, the perfect example of&nbsp;what it&nbsp;means to&nbsp;have <a href=# title=perseverance data-link=tag>perseverance</a> and tenacity.</p><p><h2>Becoming a&nbsp;mom at&nbsp;19</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/b52/a09/6a525955ac94cb72cbd54409ba.jpg><p><a href=#>Sofía Vergara</a> was married to&nbsp;Joe Gonzalez from 1991 to&nbsp;1993. As&nbsp;a&nbsp;result of&nbsp;this relationship, at&nbsp;just <a href=#>19&nbsp;years old</a>, the actress had her first son, Manolo. After her break-up with Gonzalez, Sofía put all her efforts into acting and taking care of&nbsp;the little boy so&nbsp;that he&nbsp;would never miss anything he&nbsp;needed. “I&nbsp;was really young when&nbsp;I divorced his father, so&nbsp;I raised him trying to&nbsp;set the best example and give him the best that I&nbsp;could. When people compliment me&nbsp;on&nbsp;him, on&nbsp;how well mannered, how charming, funny, and well-behaved he&nbsp;is, it&nbsp;makes all the sacrifices worthwhile,” <a href=#>says</a> Sofía.</p><p>Even though she does not regret that she became a&nbsp;mother at&nbsp;such a&nbsp;young age, she recognizes that everything would have been easier if&nbsp;Manolo had arrived 10&nbsp;years later. When the child was still very little, Sofía had to&nbsp;leave him with his grandmother to&nbsp;go&nbsp;out to&nbsp;work, and it&nbsp;broke her heart every time she did&nbsp;it. “Being a&nbsp;mother has a&nbsp;lot to&nbsp;do&nbsp;with instinct, a&nbsp;sense of&nbsp;responsibility, commitment, and even self-forgiveness,” she <a href=#>explained to&nbsp;Hispanic media</a>.</p><p><h2>How she combined her career as&nbsp;an&nbsp;actress with motherhood</h2></p><p>Sofía’s <a href=#>career</a> in&nbsp;the entertainment industry is&nbsp;very diverse and prolific. As&nbsp;years went by&nbsp;and Manolo grew&nbsp;up, the Colombian actress and model’s career really took off. In&nbsp;1995, she toured the world with Fernando Fiore thanks to&nbsp;Telemundo’s TV&nbsp;show, <a href=#>Fuera de&nbsp;serie</a>, and she later took part in&nbsp;films such as&nbsp;<a href=#>Chasing Papi</a>, <a href=#>Four Brothers</a>; and a&nbsp;rom-com classic, <a href=#>Hot Pursuit</a>, among others. She was also cast in&nbsp;a&nbsp;number of&nbsp;successful&nbsp;TV series, such as&nbsp;Family Guy and Modern Family.</p><p><h2>A&nbsp;mother that serves as&nbsp;a&nbsp;great mentor</h2></p><p>If&nbsp;there’s one thing moms excel&nbsp;at, it’s giving advice and passing on&nbsp;life lessons. And Sofía Vergara, who, as&nbsp;a&nbsp;mother, never stops worrying about her son’s well-being, is&nbsp;no&nbsp;exception. “Don’t walk down a&nbsp;back alley. Use your head. Don’t go&nbsp;alone on&nbsp;a&nbsp;train at&nbsp;3&nbsp;in&nbsp;the morning,” are some of&nbsp;the warnings the actress <a href=#>gives</a> her son, Manolo. During an&nbsp;<a href=#>interview</a> with Univision, she also said that she wanted her son to&nbsp;be&nbsp;with a&nbsp;good, educated woman, and&nbsp;he, in&nbsp;turn, acknowledges that his mom makes for an&nbsp;excellent mother-in-law.</p><p><h2>A&nbsp;boy who follows in&nbsp;mom’s footsteps</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/f57/4c4/91527757a4945009432393fe87.jpg><p><span><span>Maybe the fact that he&nbsp;grew up&nbsp;with a&nbsp;mom that was already a&nbsp;star influenced Manolo’s professional fate. The young man is&nbsp;a&nbsp;</span></span><a href=#><span><span>film director</span></span></a><span><span>. He&nbsp;is&nbsp;also a&nbsp;graduate of&nbsp;Emerson College in&nbsp;Boston. After finishing his studies, he&nbsp;returned to&nbsp;California and started his own <a href=#>YouTube channel</a> where he&nbsp;talks, among other things, about what it’s like to&nbsp;live with his mother. The </span></span><a href=#><span><span>project</span></span></a><span><span>, which is&nbsp;called&nbsp;</span></span><span><span>Mi vida con Toty</span></span><span><span> (as&nbsp;Sofía is&nbsp;affectionately called), was so&nbsp;successful that it&nbsp;gave way to&nbsp;a&nbsp;</span></span>Snapchat <span><span>reality show called </span></span><a href=#><span><span>Vergaraland</span></span></a><span><span>.</span></span></p><p><span><span>He&nbsp;later landed a&nbsp;</span></span><a href=#><span><span>role</span></span></a><span><span> in&nbsp;the movie, </span></span><span><span><a href=#>Destined to&nbsp;Ride</a>,</span></span><span><span> and played a&nbsp;role in&nbsp;the series, </span></span><a href=#><span><span>Guilty Party: History of&nbsp;Lying</span></span></a><span><span>.</span></span></p><p>But in&nbsp;addition to&nbsp;following in&nbsp;his mother’s footsteps professionally, Manolo accompanies her to&nbsp;some of&nbsp;the most important events in&nbsp;the entertainment industry, like when he&nbsp;attended the ceremony in&nbsp;which Sofía Vergara was honored with a&nbsp;star on&nbsp;the Hollywood Walk of&nbsp;Fame.</p><p><h2>A&nbsp;shared love for dogs</h2></p><p>Another thing Sofía and Manolo both have in&nbsp;common is&nbsp;their absolute devotion to&nbsp;dogs. On&nbsp;his Instagram <a href=#>account</a>, Manolo shares hundreds of&nbsp;pictures with his pets and Sofía does the same on&nbsp;<a href=#>hers</a>. In&nbsp;addition, the boy launched his own <a href=#>brand</a> of&nbsp;clothing and accessories for dogs, and the actress <a href=#>joined</a> him for the launching event.</p><p><h2>Enjoying spending time together more than anything</h2></p><p>The bond between Manolo and Sofía is&nbsp;very strong. They have been with each other through all the stages of&nbsp;their lives and have shared very important moments. The actress was with her son at&nbsp;his <a href=#>graduation</a> and was overflowed with pride and happiness about his academic achievements, while the young man was the one who <a href=#>walked</a> his mom down the aisle when she got married to&nbsp;Joe Manganiello.</p><p>On&nbsp;another occasion, Manolo stood alongside Sofía when she wrapped for her part in&nbsp;the series, Modern Family, and he&nbsp;even posted a&nbsp;message on&nbsp;his Instagram account: “11&nbsp;years, 250&nbsp;episodes, and&nbsp;I could not be&nbsp;prouder of&nbsp;the history-making work you’ve accomplished! As&nbsp;this chapter closes, I’m excited for your next one!” he&nbsp;wrote.</p><p><span><span>Undoubtedly, walking the road of&nbsp;motherhood alone and being so&nbsp;young is&nbsp;not easy. However, </span></span>Sofía<span><span> </span></span><a href=#><span><span>says</span></span></a><span><span> that now her friends panic if&nbsp;they haven’t found someone to&nbsp;have children with, but for her, that isn’t a&nbsp;problem, because she already has her own kid.</span></span></p><p>Do&nbsp;you think being a&nbsp;young mom has its advantages?
