The first four contestants who made it through were as follows:</p><p><strong>Team Kelly:</strong>&nbsp;Kenzie Wheeler</p><p><strong>Team Legend:</strong>&nbsp;Victor Solomon</p><p><strong>Team Nick:</strong>&nbsp;Rachel Mac</p><p><strong>Team Blake:</strong>&nbsp;Cam Anthony</p><p>There were some emotional moments from the artists as they waited for the results. Team Legend artist Pia Renee <a href=#>paid tearful tribute to her mother</a>, who passed away while she was competing in the show. Team Nick’s Rachel Mac also shared a message for young people who may be struggling, letting them know that their “feelings are valid, but they don’t define you.”</p><p>Blake Shelton, meanwhile, might be <a href=#>regretting his prediction about Kenzie Wheeler</a> even more this week. He’s said that the country star could win the whole show, and the viewers seem to agree with him.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" readability=2><p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q2YZdhGDJgo</p></figure><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-jake-hoot-and-kelly-clarkson-perform-their-duet>Jake Hoot and Kelly Clarkson Perform Their Duet</h3><p>Season 17 The Voice winner Jake Hoot returned to the stage to <a href=#>perform with his coach Kelly Clarkson</a> during the results show.
